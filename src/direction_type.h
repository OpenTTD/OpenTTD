 * two directions. If you get one direction you can align
 * a second direction in 8 different ways. This enumeration
 * only contains 6 of these 8 differences, but the remaining
 * two can be calculated by adding to differences together.
 * This also means you can add two differences together and
 * get the difference you really want to get. The difference
 * of 45 degrees left + the difference of 45 degrees right results in the
 * difference of 0 degrees.
 *
 * @note To get this mentioned addition of direction you must use
 *       modulo DIR_END or use the #ChangeDirDiff(DirDiff, DirDiff) function.
