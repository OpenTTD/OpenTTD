/**
 * Timer that is increased every 27ms, and counts towards ticks / days / months / years.
 *
 * The amount of days in a month depends on the month and year (leap-years).
 * There are always 74 ticks in a day (and with 27ms, this makes 1 day 1.998 seconds).
 *
 * IntervalTimer and TimeoutTimer based on this Timer are a bit unusual, as their count is always one.
 * You create those timers based on a transition: a new day, a new month or a new year.
 *
 * Additionally, you need to set a priority. To ensure deterministic behaviour, events are executed
 * in priority. It is important that if you assign NONE, you do not use Random() in your callback.
 * Other than that, make sure you only set one callback per priority.
 *
 * For example:
 *   IntervalTimer<TimerGameCalendar>({TimerGameCalendar::DAY, TimerGameCalendar::Priority::NONE}, [](uint count){});
 *
 * @note Callbacks are executed in the game-thread.
