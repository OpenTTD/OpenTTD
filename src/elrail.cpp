/**
 * @file elrail.cpp
 * This file deals with displaying wires and pylons for electric railways.
 * <h2>Basics</h2>
 *
 * <h3>Tile Types</h3>
 *
 * We have two different types of tiles in the drawing code:
 * Normal Railway Tiles (NRTs) which can have more than one track on it, and
 * Special Railways tiles (SRTs) which have only one track (like crossings, depots
 * stations, etc).
 *
 * <h3>Location Categories</h3>
 *
 * All tiles are categorized into three location groups (TLG):
 * Group 0: Tiles with both an even X coordinate and an even Y coordinate
 * Group 1: Tiles with an even X and an odd Y coordinate
 * Group 2: Tiles with an odd X and an even Y coordinate
 * Group 3: Tiles with both an odd X and Y coordinate.
 *
 * <h3>Pylon Points</h3>
 * <h4>Control Points</h4>
 * A Pylon Control Point (PCP) is a position where a wire (or rather two)
 * is mounted onto a pylon.
 * Each NRT does contain 4 PCPs which are bitmapped to a byte
 * variable and are represented by the DiagDirection enum
 *
 * Each track ends on two PCPs and thus requires one pylon on each end. However,
 * there is one exception: Straight-and-level tracks only have one pylon every
 * other tile.
 *
 * Now on each edge there are two PCPs: One from each adjacent tile. Both PCPs
 * are merged using an OR operation (i. e. if one tile needs a PCP at the position
 * in question, both tiles get it).
 *
 * <h4>Position Points</h4>
 * A Pylon Position Point (PPP) is a position where a pylon is located on the
 * ground.  Each PCP owns 8 in (45 degree steps) PPPs that are located around
 * it. PPPs are represented using the Direction enum. Each track bit has PPPs
 * that are impossible (because the pylon would be situated on the track) and
 * some that are preferred (because the pylon would be rectangular to the track).
