 * Enumeration for the slope-type.
 *
 * This enumeration use the chars N,E,S,W corresponding the
 * direction north, east, south and west. The top corner of a tile
 * is the north-part of the tile. The whole slope is encoded with
 * 5 bits, 4 bits for each corner and 1 bit for a steep-flag.
 *
 * For halftile slopes an extra 3 bits are used to represent this
 * properly; 1 bit for a halftile-flag and 2 bits to encode which
 * extra side (corner) is leveled when the slope of the first 5
 * bits is applied. This means that there can only be one leveled
 * slope for steep slopes, which is logical because two leveled
 * slopes would mean that it is not a steep slope as halftile
 * slopes only span one height level.
