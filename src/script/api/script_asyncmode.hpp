 *   The original mode is stored and recovered from when ever the instance is destroyed.
 * In Asynchronous mode all the commands you execute are queued for later execution. The
 *   system checks if it would be able to execute your requests, and returns what
 *   the cost would be. The actual cost and whether the command succeeded when the command
 *   is eventually executed may differ from what was reported to the script.
