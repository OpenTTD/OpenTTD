/**
 * Class that handles all cargo movement monitoring related functions.
 *
 * To get an understanding of what users are transporting, this class provides cargo pick-up and delivery monitoring functions.
 * It works as follows:
 * - Select a company, a cargo-type, and an industry that gets the cargo triplet.
 * - Perform a call to #GetIndustryDeliveryAmount, setting 'keep_monitoring' to \c true.
 *   The return value is not important, but from this moment the program accumulates all deliveries by
 *   the given company to the given industry of the given cargo type.
 * - Some time later, perform another call to #GetIndustryDeliveryAmount. It returns the accumulated
 *   amount of cargo that the company has delivered.
 *   The call causes the collected amount to be reset. On the next call you will thus always get the
 *   delivered amount since the previous call.
 * - When monitoring the deliveries is not interesting any more, set 'keep_monitoring' to \c false.
 *   The collecting process that happens between calls is stopped.
 *
 * In the same way you can monitor town deliveries, and you can monitor pick-up from towns and industries.
 * The latter get added at the moment the cargo is delivered. This prevents users from getting credit for
 * picking up cargo without delivering it.
 *
 * The active monitors are saved and loaded. Upon bankruptcy or company takeover, the cargo monitors are
 * automatically stopped for that company. You can reset to the empty state with #StopAllMonitoring.
