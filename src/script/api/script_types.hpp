/**
 * @file script_types.hpp Defines all the types of the game, like IDs of various objects.
 *
 * IDs are used to identify certain objects. They are only unique within the object type, so for example a vehicle may have VehicleID 2009,
 * while a station has StationID 2009 at the same time. Also IDs are assigned arbitrary, you cannot assume them to be consecutive.
 * Also note that some IDs are static and never change, while others are allocated dynamically and might be
 * reused for other objects once they are released. So be careful, which IDs you store for which purpose and whether they stay valid all the time.

 * @remarks
 *  \li \anchor newgrf_changes  (1) in-game changes of newgrfs may reassign/invalidate IDs (will also cause other trouble though).
 *  \li \anchor dynamic_engines (2) engine IDs are reassigned/invalidated on changing 'allow multiple newgrf engine sets' (only allowed as long as no vehicles are built).
