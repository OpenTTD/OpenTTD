/**
 * Class that handles window interaction. A Window in OpenTTD has two imporant
 *  values. The WindowClass, and a Window number. The first indicates roughly
 *  which window it is. WC_TOWN_VIEW for example, is the view of a town.
 * The Window number is a bit more complex, as it depends mostly on the
 *  WindowClass. For example for WC_TOWN_VIEW it is the TownID. In general a
 *  good rule of thumb is: either the number is always 0, or the ID of the
 *  object in question.
 * In the comment at the widget enum, it is mentioned how the number is used.
 *
 * Note, that the detailed window layout is very version specific.
 * Enum values might be added, changed or removed in future versions without notice
 * in the changelog, and there won't be any means of compatibility.
