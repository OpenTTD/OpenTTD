/**
 * The Controller, the class each Script should extend. It creates the Script,
 *  makes sure the logic kicks in correctly, and that #GetTick() has a valid
 *  value.
 *
 * When starting a new game, or when loading a game, OpenTTD tries to match a
 *  script that matches to the specified version as close as possible. It tries
 *  (from first to last, stopping as soon as the attempt succeeds)
 *
 *  - load the exact same version of the same script,
 *  - load the latest version of the same script that supports loading data from
 *    the saved version (the version of saved data must be equal or greater
 *    than ScriptInfo::MinVersionToLoad),
 *  - load the latest version of the same script (ignoring version requirements),
 *  - (for AIs) load a random AI, and finally
 *  - (for AIs) load the dummy AI.
 *
 * After determining the script to use, starting it is done as follows
 *
 * - An instance is constructed of the class derived from ScriptController
 *   (class name is retrieved from ScriptInfo::CreateInstance).
 * - If there is script data available in the loaded game and if the data is
 *   loadable according to ScriptInfo::MinVersionToLoad, #Load is called with the
 *   data from the loaded game.
 * - Finally, #Start is called to start execution of the script.
 *
 * See also http://wiki.openttd.org/AI:Save/Load for more details.
