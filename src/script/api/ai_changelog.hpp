 * \li AIWaypoint::WAYPOINT_INVALID, use AIBaseStation::STATION_INVALID instead
 *
 * Other changes:
 * \li The GetName / SetName / GetLocation functions were moved from AIStation
 *     and AIWaypoint to AIBaseStation, but you can still use AIStation.GetName
 *     as before
 * \li The GetConstructionDate function was moved from AIStation to
 *     AIBaseStation, but can still be used as AIStation.GetConstructionDate
 * \li WaypointID was replaced by StationID. All WaypointIDs from previous
 *     savegames are invalid. Use STATION_INVALID instead of WAYPOINT_INVALID
 * \li AIWaypointList constructor now needs a WaypointType similar to AIStationList,
 *     it can also handle buoys.
 * \li AIVehicleList_Station now also works for waypoints
 * \li Stations can be build over rail without signals that is in the right
 *     direction for the to-be built station. It will also convert the rail if
 *     the station's rail type supports the old type.
 * \li GetAPIVersion() was added as function to info.nut. If it does not exist
 *     API version 0.7 is assumed. This function should return the major and
 *     minor number of the stable version of the API the AI is written against.
 *     For 0.7.2 that would be 0.7, for 1.1.3 it would be 1.1, etc.
 * \li The subsidy logic has changed. Subsidy is now awarded when cargo
 *     originating from subsidy source is delivered to station that has subsidy
 *     destination it its catchment area. One industry tile or one town house
 *     is enough as long as station accepts the cargo. Awarded subsidies are no
 *     longer bound to stations used for first delivery, any station can be
 *     used for loading and unloading as long as cargo is transferred from
 *     source to destination.
 * \li Make AIEngine:CanRefitCargo() not report refittability to mail by
 *     default for aircraft. It is not necessarily true. This means that even
 *     if the aircraft can carry mail (as secondary cargo) it does not return
 *     true if the aircraft cannot carry it as its only cargo.
 * \li Improve behaviour of AIEngine::GetCargoType(), AIEventEnginePreview::GetCargoType()
 *     and AIEngine::CanRefitCargo() for articulated vehicles. For
 *     CanRefitCargo true is returned if at least one part can be refitted.
 *     For GetCargoType the first most used cargo type is returned.
 * \li AIIndustryType::GetConstructionCost() now returns -1 if the industry is
 *     neither buildable nor prospectable.
 * \li AIEngine::IsValidEngine will now return true if you have at least one
 *     vehicle of that type in your company, regardless if it's still buildable
 *     or not. AIEngine::IsBuildable returns only true when you can actually
 *     build an engine.
 * \li AITile::GetCargoProduction will now return the number of producers,
 *     including houses instead the number of producing tiles. This means that
 *     also industries that do not have a tile within the radius, but where
 *     the search bounding box and the industry's bounding box intersect, are
 *     counted. Previously these industries (and their cargoes), although they
 *     produced cargo for a station at the given location, were not returned.
 * \li AIRail::BuildRail will now fail completely if there is an obstacle
 *     between the begin and end, instead of building up to the obstacle and
 *     returning that everything went okay.
 * \li Orders for buoys are now waypoint orders, i.e. instead of using the
 *     station orders for buoys one has to use waypoint orders.
 * \li Autoreplaces can now also be set for the default group via AIGroup.
 *
 * \b 0.7.5 - 0.7.4
 *
 * No changes
 *
 * \b 0.7.3
 *
 * API additions:
 * \li AIAbstractList::SORT_ASCENDING
 * \li AIAbstractList::SORT_DESCENDING

 * \li AICompany::GetPresidentGender
 * \li AICompany::SetPresidentGender
 * \li AIEngine::GetDesignDate
 * \li AIStation::GetConstructionDate
 *
 * Other changes:
 * \li AIs are now killed when they execute a DoCommand or Sleep at a time
 *     they are not allowed to do so.
 * \li When the API requests a string as parameter you can give every squirrel
 *     type and it will be converted to a string
 * \li AIs can create subclasses of API classes and use API constants as part
 *     of their own constants
 *
 * \b 0.7.2
 *
 * API additions:
 * \li AIVehicle::GetReliability
 *
 * Other changes:
 * \li DoCommands and sleeps in call, acall, pcall and valuators are disallowed
 *
 * \b 0.7.1
 *
 * API additions:
 * \li AIAirport::GetPrice
 * \li AIController::GetVersion
 * \li AIOrder::AIOF_DEPOT_FLAGS
 * \li AIOrder::AIOF_STOP_IN_DEPOT
 * \li AIOrder::IsCurrentOrderPartOfOrderList
 * \li AIOrder::IsGotoDepotOrder
 * \li AIOrder::IsGotoStationOrder
 * \li AIOrder::IsGotoWaypointOrder
 * \li AISignList
 * \li AITile::CORNER_[WSEN]
 * \li AITile::ERR_AREA_ALREADY_FLAT
 * \li AITile::ERR_EXCAVATION_WOULD_DAMAGE
 * \li AITile::GetCornerHeight
 * \li AITile::GetMaxHeight
 * \li AITile::GetMinHeight
 * \li AIVehicle::SendVehicleToDepotForServicing
 *
 * Other changes:
 * \li GetURL() was added as optional function to info.nut
 * \li UseAsRandomAI() was added as optional function to info.nut
 * \li A limit was introduced on the time the AI spends in the constructor and Load function
 *
 * \b 0.7.0
 * \li First stable release with the NoAI framework.
