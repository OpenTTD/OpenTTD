 *  TROPICZONE_DESERT: Generated everywhere, if there is neither water nor mountains (TileHeight >= 4) in a certain distance from the tile.
 *  TROPICZONE_RAINFOREST: Generated everywhere, if there is no desert in a certain distance from the tile.
 *  TROPICZONE_NORMAL: Everywhere else, i.e. between desert and rainforest and on sea (if you clear the water).
 *
 * In scenarios:
 *  TROPICZONE_NORMAL: Default value.
 *  TROPICZONE_DESERT: Placed manually.
 *  TROPICZONE_RAINFOREST: Placed if you plant certain rainforest-trees.
