/**
 * String filter and state.
 *
 * The filter takes a stringterm and parses it into words separated by whitespace.
 * The whitespace-separation can be avoided by quoting words in the searchterm using " or '.
 * The quotation characters can be nested or concatenated in a unix-shell style.
 *
 * When filtering an item, all words are checked for matches, and the filter matches if every word
 * matched. So, effectively this is a AND search for all entered words.
 *
 * Once the filter is set up using SetFilterTerm, multiple items can be filtered consecutively.
 *  1. For every item first call ResetState() which resets the matching-state.
 *  2. Pass all lines of the item via AddLine() to the filter.
 *  3. Check the matching-result for the item via GetState().
