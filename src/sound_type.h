 * is different to the order they are referenced in TTD/NewGRF.
 *  - The first two sound effects from the baseset are inserted at position 39.
 *    (see translation table _sound_idx)
 *  - The order in the enum is the order using in TTD/NewGRF.
 *  - The naming of the enum values includes the position in the baseset.
 * That is, for sound effects 0x02 to 0x28 the naming is off-by-two.
