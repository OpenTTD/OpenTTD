/**
 * Game Coordinator communication.
 *
 * For servers:
 *  - Server sends CLIENT_REGISTER.
 *  - GC probes server to check if it can directly connect, needs STUN, etc.
 *  - GC sends SERVER_REGISTER_ACK with type of connection.
 *  - Server sends every 30 seconds CLIENT_UPDATE.
 *
 * For clients (listing):
 *  - Client sends CLIENT_LISTING.
 *  - GC returns the full list of public servers via SERVER_LISTING (multiple packets).
 *
 * For clients (connecting):
 *  - Client sends CLIENT_CONNECT.
 *  - GC checks what type of connections the servers supports:
 *    1) Direct connect?
 *        - Send the client a SERVER_CONNECT with the peer address.
 *        - a) Client connects, closes GC connection.
 *        - b) Client connect fails, client sends CLIENT_CONNECT_FAILED to GC.
 *  - If all fails, GC sends SERVER_CONNECT_FAILED to indicate no connection was possible.
