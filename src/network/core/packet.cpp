 * Create a packet that is used to read from a network socket.

 * @param limit             The maximum size of packets to accept.
 * @param initial_read_size The initial amount of data to transfer from the socket into the
 *                          packet. This defaults to just the required bytes to determine the
 *                          packet's size. That default is the wanted for streams such as TCP
 *                          as you do not want to read data of the next packet yet. For UDP
 *                          you need to read the whole packet at once otherwise you might
 *                          loose some the data of the packet, so there you pass the maximum
