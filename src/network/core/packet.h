/**
 * Internal entity of a packet. As everything is sent as a packet,
 * all network communication will need to call the functions that
 * populate the packet.
 * Every packet can be at most a limited number bytes set in the
 * constructor. Overflowing this limit will give an assertion when
 * sending (i.e. writing) the packet. Reading past the size of the
 * packet when receiving will return all 0 values and "" in case of
 * the string.
 *
 * --- Points of attention ---
 *  - all > 1 byte integral values are written in little endian,
 *    unless specified otherwise.
 *      Thus, 0x01234567 would be sent as {0x67, 0x45, 0x23, 0x01}.
 *  - all sent strings are of variable length and terminated by a '\0'.
 *      Thus, the length of the strings is not sent.
 *  - years that are leap years in the 'days since X' to 'date' calculations:
 *     (year % 4 == 0) and ((year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0))
