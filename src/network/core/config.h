 * Technically a TCP packet could become 64kiB, however the high bit is kept so it becomes possible in the future
 * to go to (significantly) larger packets if needed. This would entail a strategy such as employed for UTF-8.
 *
 * Packets up to 32 KiB have the high bit not set:
 * 00000000 00000000 0bbbbbbb aaaaaaaa -> aaaaaaaa 0bbbbbbb
 * Send_uint16(GB(size, 0, 15)
 *
 * Packets up to 1 GiB, first uint16_t has high bit set so it knows to read a
 * next uint16_t for the remaining bits of the size.
 * 00dddddd cccccccc bbbbbbbb aaaaaaaa -> cccccccc 10dddddd aaaaaaaa bbbbbbbb
 * Send_uint16(GB(size, 16, 14) | 0b10 << 14)
