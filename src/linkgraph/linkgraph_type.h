 * such vehicles it's 'fully restricted'. This means the link can be used
 * by cargo arriving in such vehicles, but not by cargo generated or
 * transferring at the source station of the link. In order to find out
 * about this condition we keep two update timestamps in each link, one for
 * the restricted and one for the unrestricted part of it. If either one
 * times out while the other is still valid the link becomes fully
 * restricted or fully unrestricted, respectively.
 * Refreshing a link makes just sure a minimum capacity is kept. Increasing
 * actually adds the given capacity.
