Notes about DirectMusic driver for Win32
----------------------------------------

If compiling under MinGW32, you require the DirectX 7.0 files for MinGW32, available from
http://alleg.sourceforge.net/files/dx70_mgw.zip.

If compiling under MSVC 6.0, you require the equivalent for MSVC, available from
http://alleg.sourceforge.net/files/dx70_min.zip. MSVC 7.0/7.1 include header files that
are recent enough.

If you do not want to compile the DirectMusic driver, undefine WIN32_ENABLE_DIRECTMUSIC_SUPPORT
in stdafx.h.

Bugs, etc
---------

- The volume control doesn't work properly. I'll fix this soon.
