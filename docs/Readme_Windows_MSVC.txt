Compiling OpenTTD using Microsoft Visual C++
Last updated: 2010-01-03
--------------------------------------------
PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE DOCUMENT BEFORE DOING ANY ACTUAL CHANGES!!


SUPPORTED MSVC COMPILERS
------------------------
OpenTTD includes projects for MSVC 2005.NET and MSVC 2008.NET. Both will
compile out of the box, providing you have the required libraries/headers;
which ones, see below. There is no support for VS6 or MSVC 2002, or
MSVC 2003.NET. You are therefore strongly encouraged to either upgrade to
MSVC 2008 Express (free) or use GCC.


1) REQUIRED FILES
-----------------
You might already have some of the files already installed, so check before
downloading; mostly because the DirectX SDK and Platform SDK are about
500MB each.
Download the following files:

	* openttd-useful.zip (http://binaries.openttd.org/extra/openttd-useful/)
	* DirectX 8.1 SDK (http://neuron.tuke.sk/~mizanin/eng/Dx81sdk-include-lib.rar) (or alternatively the latest DirectX SDK from Microsoft)
	* MS Windows Platform SDK (http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=A55B6B43-E24F-4EA3-A93E-40C0EC4F68E5&displaylang=en)
	* afxres.h (http://www-d0.fnal.gov/d0dist/dist/packages/d0ve/devel/windows/AFXRES.H)

...and of course the newest source from svn://svn.openttd.org/trunk

You need an SVN-client to download the source from subversion:

	* CLI Subversion (http://subversion.tigris.org/)
	* GUI TortoiseSVN (http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/)


2) INCLUDES AND LIBRARIES
-------------------------
Put the newly downloaded files in the VC lib\ and include\ directories; where
"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC" is your location of Visual C.
If you are compiling for an x64 system, use the include\ and lib\ directories
from the win64/ folder.

	* openttd-useful.zip\include\*
	* afxresh.h
	to >	C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\Include

	* openttd-useful.zip\lib\*
	to >	C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\Lib

Custom directories might be recommended, check 2.2)


2.1) INCLUDES AND LIBRARIES - DIRECTX/PLATFORM SDK
--------------------------------------------------
Basically the same procedure as with the useful zip file, providing
you are not using the Microsoft installer. Put the include files in the
include\ directory and the library files to the Lib\ directory.

It is recommended to use custom directories so you don't overwrite any
default header or library files.


2.2) CUSTOM DIRECTORIES
-----------------------
If you have put the above include and/or library files into custom folders,
MSVC will not find them by default. You need to add these paths to VC through:

Tools > Options > Projects and Solutions > VC++ Directories > show directories for

	* Include files: Add the DirectX/Platform SDK include dir you've created
	* Library files: Add the path to the SDK custom lib dir

NOTE: make sure that the directory for the DirectX SDK is the first one in the
list, above all others, otherwise compilation will most likely fail!!


3) TTD GRAPHICS FILES
---------------------
See section 4.1 of README.md for the required 3rdparty files and how to install them.


4) COMPILING
------------
Open trunk/openttd_vs[89]0.sln
Set the build mode to 'Release' in
Build > Configuration manager > Active solution configuration > select "Release"
Compile...

If everything works well the binary should be in trunk/objs/Win[32|64]/Release/openttd.exe


5) EDITING, CHANGING SOURCE CODE
--------------------------------
Set the build mode (back to) 'Debug'
Change the startup project to openttd by right-clicking the 'openttd' project
in the Solution Explorer and selecting 'Set as Startup Project'. The 'openttd'
project should now show up bold instead of 'strgen'.


6) PROBLEMS?
------------
If compilation fails, double-check that you are using the latest SVN (!)
source. If it still doesn't work, check in on IRC (irc://irc.oftc.net/openttd),
to ask about reasons; or just wait. The problem will most likely solve itself
within a few days as the problem is noticed and fixed.
