;
; Example file for the OpenTTD Base Music replacement sets.
; This file consists of basically two different parts:
;  * metadata
;  * information about the files/songs
;
; Metadata contains information about the name and version
; of the music set.
;
; == Getting started ==
; - you can't add comments after values
; - you have to fill the MD5 checksum for each file
; - you may not miss any of the metadata or files items
; - `openttd -h` lists all music replacement sets it found to be correct
; - `openttd -d grf=1` shows warnings/errors when parsing an .obm file
; - `openttd -M <name>` starts OpenTTD with the given set (case sensitive)
; - adding `musicset = <name>` to the misc section of openttd.cfg makes
;   OpenTTD start with that sound set by default
; - there is a command line tool for all platforms called md5sum that can
;   create the MD5 checksum you need.
; - all files specified in this file are search relatively to the path where
;   this file is found, i.e. if the sound files are in a subdir you have
;   to add that subdir to the names in this file to! It will NOT search for
;   a file named like specified in here.

[metadata]
; the name of the pack, preferably less than 16 characters
name         = example
; the short name (4 characters), used to identify this set
shortname    = XMPL
; the version of this sound set (read as single integer)
version      = 0
; a fairly short description of the set
; By adding '.<iso code>' you can translate the description.
; Note that OpenTTD first tries the full ISO code, then the first
; two characters and then uses the fallback (no '.<iso code>').
; The ISO code matching is case sensitive!
; So en_US will be used for en_GB if no en_GB translation is added.
; As a result the below example has 'howdie' for en_US and en_GB but
; 'foo' for all other languages.
description  = foo
description.en_US = howdie

; The files section lists the files that replace songs.
; The file names are case sensitive.
; You can have empty file names; in that case no song will be loaded
; for that 'entry'.
; If you want to load music from the MPS DOS music driver "cat" format,
; specify just the name of the .cat file the song is located in, then
; fill out the "catindex" section.

; The names section lists the song names for the given file name.
; Note that the list of files is case sensitive. Each file listed in the
; files section must be listed here with it's song name, otherwise you
; will get a lot of warnings when starting OpenTTD.
; You don't need to fill this out for "cat" format music, the song names
; are loaded directly from the file in that case.

; If a song needs to have parts of the start or end cut off to avoid long
; silences, you can specify MIDI tick codes for start:end of the actual
; music part for each file here.
; Not all music drivers might support this feature.

; The origin section provides the possibility to put and extra line into
; the warning that a file is missing/corrupt. This can be used to tell
; them where to find it. It works on the filename specified in the
; files section and if that is not found it will fall back to the default
; as shown below here.
