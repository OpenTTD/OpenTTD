1) About:
-- ------
All bugs listed below are marked as known. Please do not submit any bugs
that are the same as these. If you do, do not act surprised, because
we WILL flame you!!

Of course if you have more knowledge about any of these bugs, have more
specifics, we welcome you to report them. React to the given bug indicated
by the number below on http://bugs.openttd.org.


2) Known bugs in the this stable release:
-- --------------------------------------
The following bugs are known to exist in this stable release and
we intend to fix them. Some bugs are known but are not fixable or
fixing them would cause further problems. Those bugs can be found
in the "Known bugs that will not be solved" section.

The bugs in this section all refer to a ticket in our bug tracking system
that you can find at: http://bugs.openttd.org
If the bugs are closed but still listed here it means that the bug is fixed
and that the nightlies and next major release will not have that bug.

3) Known bugs that will not be solved:
-- -----------------------------------
This section lists all known bugs that we do not intend to fix and the
reasons why we think that fixing them is infeasible. We might make some
minor improvements that reduce the scope of these bugs, but we will not
be able to completely fix them.

Clipping problems
	In some cases sprites are not drawn as one would expect. Examples of
	this are aircraft that might be hidden below the runway or trees that
	in some cases are rendered over vehicles.
	The primary cause of this problem is that OpenTTD does not have enough
	data (like a 3D model) to properly determine what needs to be drawn in
	front of what. OpenTTD has bounding boxes but in lots of cases they
	are either too big or too small and then cause problems with what
	needs to be drawn in front of what. Also some visual tricks are used.
	For example trains at 8 pixels high, the catenary needs to be drawn
	above that. When you want to draw bridges on top of that, which are
	only one height level (= 8 pixels) higher, you are getting into some
	big problems.
	We can not change the height levels; it would require us to either
	redraw all vehicle or all landscape graphics. Doing so would mean we
	leave the Transport Tycoon graphics, which in effect means OpenTTD
	will not be a Transport Tycoon clone anymore.

Duplicate (station) names after renaming
	After renaming stations one can create duplicate station names. This
	is done giving a station the same custom name as another station with
	an automatically generated name.
	The major part of this problem is that station names are translatable.
	Meaning that a station is called e.g. '<TOWN> Central' in English and
	'<TOWN> Centraal' in Dutch. This means that in network games the
	renaming of a town could cause the rename to succeed on some clients
	and fail at others. This creates an inconsistent game state that will
	be seen as a 'desync'. Secondly the custom names are intended to fall
	completely outside of the '<TOWN> <name>' naming of stations, so when
	you rename a town all station names are updated accordingly.
	As a result the decision has been made that all custom names are only
	compared to the other custom names in the same class and not compared
	to the automatically generated names.

Forbid 90 degree turns does not work for crossing PBS paths
	When you run a train through itself on a X junction with PBS turned on
	the train will not obey the 'forbid 90 degree turns' setting. This is
	due to the fact that we can not be sure that the setting was turned
	off when the track was reserved, which means that we assume it was
	turned on and that the setting does not hold at the time. We made it
	this way to allow one to change the setting in-game, but it breaks
	slightly when you are running your train through itself. Running a
	train through means that your network is broken and is thus a user
	error which OpenTTD tries to graciously handle.
	Fixing this bug means that we need to record whether this particular
	setting was turned on or off at the time the reservation was made. This
	means adding quite a bit of data to the savegame for solving an issue
	that is basically an user error. We think it is not worth the effort.

Lost trains ignore (block) exit signals
	If trains are lost they ignore block exit signals, blocking junctions
	with presignals. This is caused because the path finders cannot tell
	where the train needs to go. As such a random direction is chosen at
	each junction. This causes the trains to occasionally to make choices
	that are unwanted from a player's point of view.
	This will not be fixed because lost trains are in almost all cases a
	network problem, e.g. a train can never reach a specific place. This
	makes the impact of fixing the bug enormously small against the
	amount of work needed to write a system that prevents the lost trains
	from taking the wrong direction.

Extreme CPU usage when using SDL and PulseAudio
	OpenTTD can be extremely slow/use a lot of CPU when the sound is
	played via SDL and then through PulseAudio's ALSA wrapper. This setup
	seems to be the default configuration for Ubuntu 9.04 and later. This
	issue can be solved by installing the 'libsdl1.2debian-pulseaudio'
	package from Ubuntu's Universe repository.
