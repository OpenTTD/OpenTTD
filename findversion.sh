Usage: ./findversion.sh
Finds the current revision and if the code is modified.

Output: <VERSION>\t<ISODATE>\t<MODIFIED>\t<HASH>
VERSION
    a string describing what version of the code the current checkout is
    based on.
    This also includes the commit date, an indication of whether the checkout
    was modified and which branch was checked out. This value is not
    guaranteed to be sortable, but is mainly meant for identifying the
    revision and user display.

    If no revision identifier could be found, this is left empty.
ISODATE
    the commit date of the revision this checkout is based on.
    The commit date may differ from the author date.
    This can be used to decide upon the age of the source.

    If no timestamp could be found, this is left empty.
MODIFIED
    Whether (the src directory of) this checkout is modified or not. A
    value of 0 means not modified, a value of 2 means it was modified.

    A value of 1 means that the modified status is unknown, because this
    is not an git checkout for example.

HASH
    the git revision hash

By setting the AWK environment variable, a caller can determine which
version of "awk" is used. If nothing is set, this script defaults to
"awk".
