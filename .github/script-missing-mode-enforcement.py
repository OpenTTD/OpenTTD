"""
Script to scan the OpenTTD's script API for functions that miss checks for the
function being called from the right mode (deity or company mode).

When a function calls either ScriptObject::Command or ScriptObject::GetCompany
then the function is considered dangerous. When one of the mode enforcement
macros from script_error.hpp, i.e. EnforceDeityMode, EnforceCompanyModeValid or
EnforceDeityOrCompanyModeValid, are called in the function, then we consider
that the function has mode enforcement.

Any dangerous function for which no enforcement is found are emitted as errors.
