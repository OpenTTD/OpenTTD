- Fix: [NoGo] Some news messages would cause an assertion to be triggered due to a missing proper location for the viewport of the news message, so only allow building when valid data for the viewport is provided or no viewport is used [FS#5054] (r23924)
- Fix: Consider only the middle tile of a lock for lock-infrastructure costs. The other two tiles may be owned by other companies. Also do not count the middle tile of a lock as canal, independent of whether it is build on ground or river slope (r23920)
- Fix: [NewGRF] When determining the first refittable cargotype according to CTT order, do not rely on the GRF assigning the refit_mask property. Also check for GRFs setting the default_cargo or refittable-cargo-classes or -types properties (r23916)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Do not test validity of cargobits using a mask of cargoslots (r23914)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Feature: [NewGRF] Give NewGRF defined level crossings and rail depots access to the townzone (r23866)
- Feature: [NewGRF] New algorithm (activated via an engine flag) to determine the capacity of vehicles. This allows vehicles to better control the capacity for cargotypes which they know; and let cargo NewGRFs influence the capacity for cargoes the vehicle NewGRF does not know, but which the vehicle is refittable to due to cargo classes (r23861)

- Fix: Railtype overlays were drawn 'only transparent' on invisible bridges (r23864)
- Fix: Inserting conditional orders for ships checked the wrong orders wrt. maximum distance (r23859)
- Fix: Out of bounds read for slowdown parameter caused desync when railtype >= 4, vehicles were fast, and the original acceleration model was used [FS#5007] (r23855)
- Fix: Infrastructure cache could get out of sync when overbuilding a drive through road stop (r23851)
- Fix: When the network is lagging, you try to copy a vehicle's order but accidentally create a station order and then copy the vehicle's order (before the first command is executed) one could trigger an assertion from the pool [FS#5008] (r23849)
- Fix: When removing road or tram from a tram+road stop, the owner of the road stop's cache was updated instead of the owner of the removed infrastructure (r23847)

- Fix: Infrastructure count of canals/locks/ship depots was not updated properly when a company went into bankruptcy or was taken over [FS#4921] (r23686)
- Fix: When fitting another engine the cargo capacity of wagons could become lower, causing them to contain more than they should. This caused the cargo transfer from the replaced parts to put even more stuff in the already full wagon. Prevent this from happening by reducing the amount of cargo in the vehicle to the capacity when moving vehicles/wagons around, or when autoreplacing [FS#4912] (r23683)
- Fix: Vehicle numbers got miscounted when autoreplacing failed due to length checks [FS#4914] (r23681)

- Fix: Old TTO/TTD savegames could get non-stop via orders upon savegame loading, even when those orders did not exist back then. This 'conversion' feature is something for TTDPatch and old OpenTTD savegames [FS#4716] (r22914)

- Fix: When a game uses a lot of NewGRFs the buffer for storing that information in the PNG is too small (r22388)
- Fix: Windows' recv seems to return 'graceful closed' before having passed the remaining buffer which causes OpenTTD to think all connections are 'incorrectly' terminated, i.e. without the 'I am leaving' packet from the client. So let the client wait a tiny bit after sending the 'I am leaving' packet and before gracefully closing the connection [FS#4601] (r22387)

- Fix: Keep better accounting of the order in which clients joined; client cannot be starved from joining and they get shown the amount of clients waiting in front of them (r22372, r22370, r22369, r22368, r22367, r22366, r22365, r22364, r22363, r22362, r22361)
- Fix: Make sure saving has completely and utterly finished before starting a new one. Otherwise you could start a save, which would be marked as done by the previous save stopping and then yet another save could be started... and that could create a deadlock [FS#4596] (r22371)
- Fix: Delete the client list popup when the client got removed (instead of previously selecting some other client) (r22360, r22359, r22358)
- Fix: When inserting automatic orders, do not create consecutive duplicate orders (r22333, r22332, r22331, r22330, r22329, r22328, r22327)
- Fix: Destinations of conditional orders were update incorrectly when deleting orders in front of the conditional orders, if the target order was the order just before of the conditional order (r22326)
- Fix: Vehicles skipped orders when inserting automatic orders failed (r22324)
- Fix: [NewGRF] When determining refittability use the cargo translation table of the GRF setting the refitmask instead of the GRF defining the action 3 (r22316)
- Fix: Make road vehicles, ships and aircraft skip orders if they are leaving a depot and heading to the same one again; just like trains (r22309)
- Fix: Waiting on a server could kick the client, or rather the client would kick itself due to an unexpected packet [FS#4574] (r22308)
- Fix: When drawing the town authority window, check whether the availability of the actions changed, and force a complete redraw in that case (r22307)
- Fix: The 'freeform edges' setting could be enabled when there were buoys on the northern border [FS#4580] (r22297)
- Fix: Reset Window::scrolling_scrollbar when raising scrollbar buttons [FS#4571] (r22294)


1.1.0 (2011-04-01)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: In the scenario editor you could build a ship depot using the appropriate hotkey. Removing that depot causes an assertion to trigger [FS#4558] (r22266)


1.1.0-RC3 (2011-03-18)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: New game settings were applied too early when starting a game via a heightmap [FS#4557] (r22259)
- Fix: Do not resort town, industry and signs list directly in OnInvalidateData(). There might be a scheduled rebuild which needs execution first. So, only set a trigger for resorting [FS#4546] (r22249, r22248, r22247, r22246, r22245, r22244, r22243, r22242, r22241, r22236, r22228, r22227, r22226)

- Fix: Compilation when compiling with --disable-ai (r22222)
- Fix: When downloading a file via HTTP failed mid-way and OpenTTD fell back to the old system the partial downloaded amount would be counted twice [FS#4543] (r22208)
- Fix: The 'center' (for movement) of vehicles is (currently still) always at 4/8th original vehicle length from the front, so trains should stop at the same location regardless of the length of the front engine [FS#4545] (r22206)
- Fix: Make the base costs for building and demolishing NewObjects also local to the individual NewGRFs (r22204)
- Fix: Removing a station order could stop when removing first automatic order (r22200)
- Fix: Invalidate the object build window when using the date cheat (r22193)


1.1.0-RC2 (2011-03-04)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: Following a vehicle with a very high VehicleID was impossible (r22181)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Memory leak if an industry NewGRF had more than one prop A or 15, or a station NewGRF had more than one prop 09 (r22175, r22165)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Disable a station NewGRF when it contains an unterminated spritelayout in action0 prop 08 instead of crashing (r22164)
- Fix: Building a station part adjacent to both an existing station and a rail waypoint failed [FS#4541] (r22163)
- Fix: No update of NewGRF window when unknown GRF name becomes available [FS#4533] (r22162)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Industry prop 0x11 is 4-bytes long, not 3 bytes (r22157)
- Fix: Stations/infrastructure were not properly sold on some clients during bankruptcy [FS#4529] (r22154)
- Fix: The Greek translation did not work as it breached the 200.000 bytes 'limit' for loading language files [FS#4536] (r22153)
- Fix: Windows video driver crashed when it could not go to full screen at the resolution of the configuration file when starting OpenTTD [FS#4521] (r22149)
- Fix: Do not run savegame conversion during SlNullPointers; the pointer might not be converted or be NULL at that point (r22146)
- Fix: Some valid keycodes were ignored along with the invalid ones (r22142)
- Fix: When commands need to invalidate windows, process these events asynchronously before the next redraw. Calling window code directly from command scope uses wrong _current_company and might issue nested DoCommands() which interfere with the running command [FS#4523] (r22141, r22140, r22135, r22134)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Skipping only the invalid part of an action14 failed, the rest of the action was skipped instead (r22138)
- Fix: Spectators had crashes when closing buoy windows (r22131)
- Fix: Build-station-window showed wrong selection when reopening [FS#4530] (r22128)
- Fix: Canals would get drawn as land in the smallmap when using the owner window (r22127)
- Fix: The animation-ness of two goldmine tiles were swapped, causing the wheeltower to not work properly, and the bottom corner to show the wrong sprite [FS#4528] (r22125)
- Fix: CommandQueue::Pop() did not update 'last'; popping the last item caused the queue to disconnect unless there was only one item [FS#4522] (r22123)
- Fix: When a NOT_REACHED in saveload can be reached due to an invalid savegame, use SlErrorCorrupt instead. In other words, do not crash but show an error message (r22122)
- Fix: In case of high frame_freq one could get commands executed after a new network game was started (r22121)
- Fix: [NoAI] Prevent AIs from getting consistently over their allowed amount of operations by subtracting the amount they went over 'budget' from the budget for the next 'tick' (r22120)
- Fix: The refit window was not correctly updated after selecting with Ctrl+Click [FS#4525] (r22118)
- Fix: CanRemoveRoadWithStop() failed for _current_company = OWNER_TOWN, and for OWNER_NONE-owned road (r22117)

- Feature: Wheel scrolling in the console (r21982)
- Feature: Console command to reset the engine pool. It removes the traces of engines which are no longer associated to a NewGRF, and can be used to e.g. 'fix' scenarios which were screwed up by the author. You can only use it when there are no vehicles in the game though (r21975)
- Feature: Add a setting to enable/disable funding local road reconstruction (r21974)
- Feature: Introduce 'minimal' number of industries as a replacement for the old 'none' setting in the new game window (r21969)
- Change: When loading old savegames with long trains set the maximum train length to the length of the longest train (r22061)
- Change: Always report mammoth trains are disabled to NewGRFs, and allow the maximum train length to be modified in multiplayer as well [FS#4471] (r22004)
- Fix: Remove invalid keycodes when reading hotkeys.cfg [FS#4510] (r22094)
- Fix: The server list did not get sorted with one item in it, so the 'position in the list' variable was never updated causing problems when using the keyboard shortcuts for scrolling [FS#4514] (r22093)
- Fix: When deleting towns, only relocate objects during DC_EXEC (r22087)
- Fix: [Windows] If fullscreen fails with current resolution, use desktop resolution [FS#4489] (r22081)
- Fix: The owner view of the smallmap was not updated after a company colour change (r22079)
- Fix: Maximum train length interfered with wagon replacement when wagon removal was turned on [FS#4499] (r22078)
- Fix: NewGRFs with invalid multi-tile houses could cause a valid 1x1 house following it to be seen as multi-tile, causing crashes [FS#4501] (r22075)
- Fix: Immediately update the train weight when you change the multiplier for train cargo weight (r22073)
- Fix: Some hotkey names in hotkey.cfg for the scenario editor toolbar were completely bogus (r22071)
- Fix: Crashes when disconnecting after requesting the map [FS#4503] (r22070)
- Fix: Delete all savegame packets, not just the first one (r22069)
- Fix: Return 'connection lost' instead of 'okay' when SendPackets closed the connection, so we do not try to do anything else with the closed socket (r22068)
- Fix: Do not hold a mutex when sending packets and thus possibly closing the connection as that wants to acquire the mutex again (r22067)
- Fix: Verify we can allocate an Order, OrderList, CargoPacket, CargoPayment, and others before we actually try to do so (all corner cases) [FS#4468] (r22066, r22057, r22047, r22042, r22040, r22033, r22031, r22026, r22025, r22024, r22023, r22022)
- Fix: Crash when disconnecting and reconnecting while the server is still saving the savegame [FS#4497] (r22064)
- Fix: Memory leak when saving with LZMA or zlib fails mid-way (r22062)
- Fix: Make the send chat message window follow the position of the status bar (r22059)
- Fix: Metric and imperial HP are not the same. As imperial HP are used internally, set a conversion rate for metric HP [FS#4408] (r22056)
- Fix: [Squirrel] Some invalid squirrel code caused the squirrel compiler to crash [FS#4490] (r22055)
- Fix: The land area information window was not updated after a language change (r22053)
- Fix: Roads under road stops would get a wrong owner after overbuilding (r22051)
- Fix: In ancient savegames, e.g. TTO savegames, non primary vehicles (wagons and such) could have unitnumbers or even orders. However, these orders would not be updated when a station is removed. As such some savegames have wagons with current orders to invalid stations which triggers trouble in the load conversion. So, trash any orders/unitnumbers a non-primary vehicle has [FS#4496] (r22050)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Company 0 does not always exist, so put temporary vehicles in a valid company (r22048)
- Fix: Make sure order indices stay in range when copying, sharing, unsharing or deleting all orders [FS#4487] (r22046)

- Fix: Tab completion in chat did not cycle through all possible options (r22038)
- Fix: Crash when watching the vehicle view of a vehicle that has multiple sequential nearest depot orders (or consists of a single nearest depot order) when there is no depot with index 0 [FS#4488] (r22034)
- Fix: The server list got not resorted/redrawn after NewGRFs were downloaded [FS#4482] (r22029)
- Fix: When paused and having the allowed actions while paused setting on 'no actions' cheating money would fail [FS#4479] (r22016)
- Fix: Only show one AI per unique ID instead of all versions in the output of 'openttd -h' (r22007)
- Fix: Smoke/sparks of trains would be shown under bridges, or rather through bridges [FS#4480] (r22006)
- Fix: When the difference between force and resistance is smaller than the mass(*4) there would be no acceleration anymore, even when at higher (or lower) speed the force and resistance balance out better [FS#4473] (r21997)
- Fix: [YAPF] Under some circumstances vehicles could be lost [FS#4472] (r21996)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Make computations of closest-land/water-distances handle waterish tiles more correctly (r21994)
- Fix: When building a lock on dry land costs for clearing water were deducted rather than for building canals (r21993)
- Fix: AIs trying to change the AIOF_GOTO_NEAREST_DEPOT flag for existing orders triggered an assert. Explicitly forbid this as precondition for SetOrderFlags [FS#4467] (r21992)
- Fix: The share/copy-orders-cursor was not updated to refer to the new vehicle when it got autoreplaced/-renewed [FS#4466] (r21991)
- Fix: Vehicle status bar glitches on speed changes (r21989)
- Fix: Scrolling of the console in pages used wrong line height and scrolled too much (r21979)
- Fix: Redraw the town authority window after modifying town authority settings (r21973)
- Fix: Crash when a multiplayer company goes bankrupt with 'you' in it [FS#4464] (r21970)

- Change: [NewGRF] Disable the flipping of train engines/wagons in the depot by default for NewGRFs [FS#4462] (r21966)
- Change: Show the length of vehicles in tiles, instead of half tiles in the depot (r21960)
- Change: Replace longbridges settings with custom maximum bridge and tunnel length setting (r21959)
- Change: Randomise the vehicle a small UFO targets, do not use the one with lowest index (r21949)
- Fix: Do not count the number of vehicles but the length of vehicles to (configurably) limit train length [FS#4461] (r21960)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Reset the carry flag every 4 bytes in Action 6 when adding more than one variable (r21951)

- Fix: Not all vehicles should be tested to be inside a tunnel upon savegame load [FS#4460] (r21940)
- Fix: Do not remove existing road/tram bits when overbuilding stops of the opposite road type [FS#4457] (r21936)
- Fix: Allow to overbuild road stops which are built over trams (r21935)
- Fix: Automatic orders behave now stable wrt. service orders and are not added or removed depending on the need of servicing [FS#4440] (r21933)
- Fix: The town window would not be invalidated in the scenario editor if the ground changed and thus the required cargoes for town growth [FS#4554] (r21929)
- Fix: Converting an expensive rail type to a cheap one could give more money than removing and rebuilding cost (r21919)
- Fix: Languages improperly sorted in the 'start server' window [FS#4443] (r21918)
- Fix: The minimum speed needed for (realistic) acceleration to work properly can sometimes be more than the (temporary) maximum speed causing Clamp to 'fail'. Make sure that the minimum speed always overrules the maximum speed [FS#4442] (r21916)
- Fix: Include the capacity of non-refittable vehicles in the refitted-capacity, if their cargo matches (r21904)
- Fix: Do not count articulated parts when passing the number of vehicles to refit to the command. That may exceed 8 bits (r21902)
- Fix: [NoAI] Hide automatic orders from AIs as they have no way of dealing with them (r21900)
- Fix: Do not show a vehicle selection in the RefitWindow for refit orders. You cannot select anything anyway (r21899)
- Fix: Using a pointer-iterator and adding things (thus reallocating) to the iterated array caused OpenTTD to crash on invalid pointers [FS#4438] (r21898)
- Fix: Only some scenarios from the main scenario folder and no heightmaps could be started in the 'start server' window [FS#4421] (r21892)
- Fix: Crash when scrolling outside of the main window (with some video backends) [FS#4434] (r21889)
- Fix: [NewGRF] String codes 0x80 and 0x81 were broken since the typechecking of string parameters [FS#4422] (r21885)
- Fix: When a train after reversing ended at the last bit of a bridge ramp and directed outside the bridge, it could still have track set to TRACK_BIT_WORMHOLE (r21880)
- Fix: When a single-vehicle train was reversed while on a slope, its GOINGUP/DOWN were not swapped (r21874)
- Remove: Settings for vehicle speed in the vehicle view, long date in status bar, drawing of bridge pillars, support for depot orders, time tabling and joining of stations upon building (r21958, r21957, r21956, r21955, r21954)
- Remove: The non-uniform stations setting; it has been broken for over a year, and thus not used [FS#4456] (r21953)


1.1.0-beta4 (2011-01-21)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Feature: [NewGRF] Rail type property to influence sorting of rail types in the drop down list [FS#4394] (r21866)
- Feature: [Network] Console command to change the password of other companies for servers [FS#4368] (r21855)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Introduction dates/required types for rail types; e.g. introduce a particular rail type in 1960 (or when a vehicle using it is introduced), but also allow limiting its introduction to only happen when the required railtypes are available [FS#4393] (r21842)
- Feature: Limit vehicle lateness to the length of a full timetable cycle, e.g. when a cycle takes 50 days and the vehicle is 65 days later reduce the lateness to 15 days (r21832)
- Feature: After building a road or tram bridge/tunnel, connect it to any existing road or tram (r21778, r21777)
- Feature: Display NewGRF object sprites during object picking (r21772)

- Change: Keep aqueducts and road/tram tunnels and bridges after removing a company (r21780)
- Fix: Distant-join station would build at the wrong location when having persistent building turned on and selecting a 'second' location for the station tile [FS#4430] (r21864)
- Fix: Slowing down of trains was done by reducing the speed by 10%, but also when you are just 1% too fast, so limit the slowdown till the new maximum speed [FS#4423] (r21847)
- Fix: Left-mouse-button dragging would switch over to other viewports instead of staying locked to the viewport you started on [FS#4419] (r21837)
- Fix: When a train was reversed while inside a tunnel/bridge, it would not have (re)set the GOINGUP/DOWN bits after leaving the tunnel/bridge (r21836)
- Fix: Desync debug savegames might not be actually saved in case threading is enabled, which is enabled by default [FS#4427] (r21833)
- Fix: Service orders for trains/aircraft would (sometimes) not get a time when autofilling [FS#4414] (r21831)
- Fix: Crash with the small map window on big endian platforms [FS#4417] (r21830)
- Fix: The expectations from the 'always build infrastructure' setting name/description did not match the behaviour [FS#4007] (r21826)
- Fix: Allow dragging of combo signals (again) [FS#4378] (r21816)
- Fix: [YAPF] Apply a pathfinder penalty for back of one-way path signals so those are not preferred over other possibilities [FS#3908] (r21815)
- Fix: Check GRF version from action 8, and disallow usage of GRFs with versions above 7 (r21814)
- Fix: Crash when displaying the owner view [FS#4411] (r21813)
- Fix: Do not create automatic orders when there are no manual orders, and remove unreached automatic orders when reaching an ordered waypoint or depot [FS#4404] (r21809, r21808)

1.1.0-beta3 (2011-01-09)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Feature: Configurable limit amount of tiles that can be cleared/terraformed by a company [FS#4331] (r21728)

- Feature: Allow changing the AI configuration in the scenario editor / in game [FS#4362] (r21696)
- Change: Tune 'realistic' acceleration even more to make more trains reach their top speed, and make it behave more like TTDPatch (r21712)
- Change: Display the minimum height of the tile in the LandInfo window instead of the height of the northern corner. So it is more useful for NewGRF and AI developers, and maybe more transparent for players (r21711)
- Fix: The diagonal iterator would iterate twice over some tiles [FS#4395] (r21747)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Canal variable 83 accessed water random bits also for non-water tiles (e.g. watery industries or objects) (r21746)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Canal variable 80 shall return consistent heights within a lock (r21745)
- Fix: Allow Ctrl+Clicking automatic orders for scrolling to their destination (r21744)
- Fix: Coast tiles were not drawn under bridges [FS#4386] (r21743)
- Fix: Make clearing refit orders work again [FS#4388] (r21739)
- Fix: Start loading when cur_order_index points to the destination station, i.e. after deleting not-reached automatic orders [FS#4384] (r21738)
- Fix: A loading order was also marked as 'not part of orders' when the order before the current order was deleted (r21737)
- Fix: Admin bots were not always notified of password changes [FS#4377] (r21727)
- Fix: Vehicle sprite was cached into a 16 bit variable, causing incorrect sprites to be displayed (r21709)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Report TTDPatch flag 4A (newobjects) as set (r21708)
- Fix: The old ship pathfinder is too stupid to provide 'lost' notices; it would even get lost while following its own path [FS#4370] (r21706)
- Fix: Do not perform any more checks after the connection is closed [FS#4374] (r21704)
- Fix: Changing AI settings ingame was impossible when the difficulty level was other than custom (r21694)
- Fix: Due to an error in the Debian changelog building of Debian/Ubuntu packages failed (r21682)


1.1.0-beta2 (2010-12-31)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Feature: Command logging using the admin interface (r21668)
- Feature: Concept of automatic station orders; add stub orders for intermediate stations and remove them when not visiting them anymore. This allows you to see what trains visit a station without actually having to order a vehicle to stop at all stations (r21642)
- Add: [NoAI] AIEventTownFounded (r21664)
- Add: [NoAI] AIRail::GetName() to get the name of a railtype (r21663)
- Add: [NoAI] AITown::IsCity() so AIs can find out which towns grow faster than others (r21654)
- Change: Do not show price to build a bridge in the scenario editor as they are free to build there [FS#4358] (r21673)
- Change: Do not highlight tile when selecting a vehicle to clone or an order to skip to (r21616)
- Fix: Estonia introduced the Euro in 2011 (r21670)
- Fix: Autofill timetable had side effects in test mode, possibly causing desyncs in MP [FS#4354] (r21660)
- Fix: Cargo payment graph was not properly invalidated when payment rate changed [FS#4351] (r21658)
- Fix: Use a bool instead of uint8 to store a bool and use the dedicated accessor function when reading boolean settings [FS#4345] (r21656)
- Fix: Infinite loop in the road pathfinder due to bouncing around in an 'one way' trap; two one ways pointing towards each other making it impossible to leave [FS#4338] (r21651)
- Fix: Make '[centre|main] view' consistent, and make '[main|global] view' consistent [FS#4339] (r21650)
- Fix: Newly created skip-to order was created at wrong place (r21633)
- Fix: Ships with the old pathfinder would easily show up as lost, even when it would eventually find a path. Now also the distance from the 'end' of the pathfinding run to the destination is compared to the current distance to the destination; if the distance to the destination at the end of the pathfinder run is less than the current distance from the destination the ship will not be marked as lost. This means that the ships with the old pathfinder will less likely get marked as lost, but due to the design of the old ship pathfinder there 'lostness' is merely a best guess. When you still get a lost message you need to build buoys to guide the ship pathfinder [FS#4325] (r21631)
- Fix: Version detection of subversion branches and tags got broken (r21630)
- Fix: Crash under certain circumstances when using autorail [FS#4327] (r21619)

- Feature: Building while paused always works in the scenario editor [FS#1521] (r21430)
- Feature: Perform the compression of savegames to send to the client asynchronously. This will reduce the lag of the other clients to the time it takes to make the memory dump and it will speed up downloading the map as the download starts earlier (possibly with a slightly lower bandwidth due to slow compression) [FS#4284] (r21399)

- Feature: A simple sprite alignment helper. It does not store the new offsets anywhere so as soon as the sprite is reloaded the offsets are gone (use a bigger sprite cache if this happens). Also anything that reloads NewGRFs (new games, loading games or (re)applying NewGRFs) clears the sprite cache and as such resets the offsets (r19723)

- Add: Support for MSVC 2010 (r20032)
- Add: [NoAI] AIIndustry::GetIndustryID(TileIndex) (r19773)
- Change: Make it possible to start actions that require selecting stuff (landscaping, vehicle cloning, etc) in the viewport while paused. As side-effect you will get an error message explaining the command cannot be executed because the game is paused instead of seemingly nothing happening when you click. Additional side effect of this is that you can make use of the measurement tooltip while paused [FS#4292] (r21480)
- Change: Make building aqueducts behave more like building tunnels. They cannot be built on flat (or foundation) tiles, so there is at most one destination tile like there is only one for tunnels [FS#4153] (r21471)
- Change: Place the bridge building window under the mouse instead of somewhere randomly on the screen and change the default sort order [FS#3975] (r21460)
- Change: Make sure the client is listening, or rather receiving, our frames (r21361)
- Change: Read some metadata from (official) source tarballs so you will more likely get the right version/revision out-of-the-box (r21351)
- Change: Be more explicit that the game state can get broken by changing NewGRFs (r21335)
- Change: Use the last red instead of last red exit penalty for making sure other waypoint entries are evaluated as well when they are occupied, e.g. when there are no signals before the waypoint but a train just beyond the waypoint is stopped (like for stations) (r21271)
- Change: Do not receive money for removing the rail of non-rail rail station tiles, i.e. rail station tiles for which the NewGRF has prevented trains to be routed through (r21266)
- Change: Show a different 'lag' message when a client is lagging because of connection trouble or lagging because the client is just slow (r21254)
- Change: Mention the OpenTTD version on the console/logs when starting an OpenTTD dedicated server like we mention it in the title bar for the GUI version (r21253)

- Change: Limit the number of exceptions in the refittable cargo list to 7 (r21083)
- Change: Reduce the chances to accidentally break savegames with NewGRFs by limiting loading of savegames that miss NewGRFs or change NewGRF settings in-game [FS#3012] (r21116)
- Change: Tuned realistic acceleration to be a bit more realistic in order to make acceleration 'slower', which highlights the differences between vehicle types more (r21106)
- Change: Do not make client reconnect waiting time depend on the company; in coop games that does not spread clients at all, and most companies have a low number causing it not to be spread out either. Use the ClientID instead (r21008)
- Change: Add installing options or rather options to not install certain documentation, in a similar way to GRFCodec/catcodec (r20999)
- Change: Only display liveries in the livery window if they are used by some vehicle somewhen (r20849)

- Change: [NewGRF] Adapt vehicle var FE bit 6 to new railtypes (r20175)
- Change: [NewGRF] Call callbacks 14A, 14B and 14C after all industry variables have been assigned, so more variables are valid during the callbacks (r19907)
- Change: [NoAI] Remove HasNext() from all lists/iterators and add IsEnd() instead (r19294)
- Change: Add the default installation directory of lzo/zlib for Mac OS X/MinGW to the paths where (the headers of) those libraries are searched [FS#3638] (r19285)
- Fix: Crash due to cargo payments belonging to a non-existing company [FS#4324] (r21605)
- Fix: Company league table used stats from two quarters ago instead of last quarter [FS#4323] (r21601)

- Fix: The server did not check for the paused state when allowing to execute commands [FS#3771] (r21429)
- Fix: Vehicles could be built while the game is paused. Now you can enable or disable that with a setting, which replaces the build-while-paused cheat [FS#4021] (r21428)

- Fix: Under some circumstances two vehicles could leave a non drive-through road stop at once [FS#3935] (r21263)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Custom station foundations using the 'simple foundations'-method did not draw any sprite for WSE-slopes when there are foundations on both neighboured tiles in the north. As there must be at least one sprite to provide the correct offset for the groundsprite draw the (empty) default foundation sprite in that case [FS#4246] (r21262)
- Fix: The main menu error messages would not show when you had an error message open in the game while whatever triggered you to go back to the main menu (r21255)
- Fix: Rescanning AIs did not 'forget' removed AIs [FS#3952] (r21250)
- Fix: Upon rescanning AIs the new AIs would (after some time) show up in the AI list but you could not select all (r21246)
- Fix: [YAPF] Road vehicles not finding the nearest depot in some (corner) cases [FS#4130] (r21229)
- Fix: [NewGRF] The specs' cargo strings and OpenTTD's use of the clashed. Provide properties so NewGRFs can provide cargo strings tailored for OpenTTD while retaining (some) backward compatibility [FS#4172] (r21224)
- Fix: Use proper plural for the short cargo unit names (r21223)

- Fix: Refit costs were not shown for long cargo names [FS#4160] (r20921)
- Fix: When using non-smooth or NewGRF-economy changing production rates does not work, so allow changing the production multiplier instead (r20901)
- Fix: The station with the second highest rating was doubly penalised when distributing cargo. Now the penalty is completely removed and the granularity/precision of the distribution in increased by using fractional cargo. This should make competing stations less all-or-nothing [FS#3637] (r20857)

- Fix: Refit costs from refit orders are subtracted from the vehicle yearly income [FS#3988] (r20234)
- Fix: Road vehicles could be dead locked with one way roads. This allows one wayness to be removed if there are vehicles on a tile; it does not allow you to add one wayness to roads that have vehicles on them as it makes turning vehicles jump [FS#3961] (r20230)
- Fix: 'Service at nearest depot' behaved the same as 'Go to nearest depot' [FS#3986] (r20229)
- Fix: Depot did not become unsnowy, when snowline rises [FS#3976] (r20224)

- Fix: If after loading a savegame (including intro game) one tried to save a game (including autosave) and that failed (very) early on because it could not open the file for writing all pointers would be converted to NULLs which then causes corrupted game states [FS#3786, FS#3887, FS#3920, FS#3923] (r20087)

This can happen in two ways: with frame_freq > 1 a command received in a previous frame might not be executed yet or when a command is received in the same frame as the join but before the savegame is made. In both cases the joining client would not get all commands to get in-sync with the server (and the other clients) (r19620)

- Fix: Window::OnResize() was not always called while resizing a window causing incorrect windows [FS#3730] (r19563, r19558)
- Fix: Bridge build error message should not show the same message twice (r19560, r19559)

- Fix: Improperly scaled cargo payment graph when having lots of cargo (r19550, 19543)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Properties set before property 08 (house, industry, industry tiles) should be ignored, not trigger the NewGRF to be disabled [FS#3725] (r19547)
- Fix: Sorting industries by production was broken for NewGRF industries (r19538)
- Fix: Vehicle details window did not resize correctly after refitting a road vehicle to a longer variant [FS#3720] (r19533)
- Fix: Prevent drawing industries disabled at the smallmap as land tiles when they are built on water (r19523)

- Change: Use zł instead of zl for the Polish Zloty [FS#565] (r18434)
- Change: Show different texts in town GUI when the town does not need food the whole year to grow (r18433)
- Change: Make road vehicles behave more like trains 'around' stations and use pathfinder penalties to determine to which 'part' to go (r18382)
- Change: Do not split up articulated vehicles in the train details view. If an articulated vehicle it too 'wide' draw the information on the next line and if there are multiple cargoes split that over multiple lines too [FS#2923] (r18344)
- Change: Make pause on join pause during the whole joining (including download) phase [FS#3287] (r18054)
- Change: Prefer extmidi over allegro midi and allegro over null driver [FS#3272] (r17875)
- Change: Several improvements to the performance of CargoPackets/CargoLists; time spent in those functions reduces by 55-85% (r17840, r17836, r17818, r17814, r17812, r17801, r17736, r17735, r17733, r17731, r17730)
- Change: [SDL] Make 'update the video card'-process asynchronous. Improvements of 2%-25% (real time) during fast forward on dual core/hyperthreading-enabled CPUs (r17776)
- Change: [NoAI] Make AIEngine:CanRefitCargo() not report refittability to Mail by default for aircraft. It is not necessarily true, and the special case of carrying both passenger&mail is better handled by AIs themself than by the API (r17719)
- Change: [OSX] Do not use deprecated methods/undocumented functions [FS#1411] (r17712, r17711)
- Change: Make SDL's video driver more likely to be loaded than Allegro's video driver; SDL seems to perform better (r17583)
- Change: Do not assume that there is always 'another' industry tile after two '0x18' industry tiles (r17521)
- Change: Make the performance ratings harder to exploit; only count profitable vehicles and recently serviced stations [FS2459] (r17485)
- Change: When removing a station or waypoint keep the rail unless Ctrl is pressed. This makes the behaviour consistent between the two (r17471)
- Change: Show the client id in join messages at the server (r17467)
- Change: NewGRF price modifiers now take effect every time when loading NewGRFs instead of once on gamestart (r17433)

- Change: Update MiniLZO to 2.0.3 (r17215)
- Change: Update Squirrel to 2.2.3 (r17195)
- Change: Remove UNICODE notice in windows installer (r17186)
- Change: Apply the subsidy when subsidy's destination is in station's catchment area and cargo packets originate from subsidy's source [FS#265,FS#2094,FS#2589] (r17113)
- Change: Subsidies are not bound to stations after awarding anymore, they still apply to town or industry, no matter what station is used for loading and unloading. Awarded subsidies from older savegames are lost [FS#1134] (r17113)
- Change: [NoAI] Add AIBaseStation as a parentclass for AIStation and AIWaypoint, and move GetName, SetName and GetLocation to AIBaseStation (r17011)
- Fix: Conditional orders were seen as 'valid' and as such aircraft with only conditional orders did not crash (r18615)
- Fix: Pressing default for the starting year/snow line height edit boxes of the world generation windows did not work [FS#3398] (r18586)
- Fix: [OSX] Try to get a generic RGB colour space if getting the system colour profile failed [FS#3198] (r18573)
- Fix: [NewGRF] House property 15 did not work [FS#2613] (r18567)
- Fix: Do not try to overtake a vehicle in a road station as overtaking in a station is not allowed [FS#3390] (r18561)
- Fix: Make aircraft behave the same on autoreplace/autorenew as other vehicle types (r18553)
- Fix: First do the time-since-last-service check and only then determine whether autoreplace needs to take place. This way they will not keep autoreplacing continuously on failure, but only after some timeout. Also check some minimal requirements (engine availability, refittability) and a heuristic for the needed money when sending vehicles for autoreplace [FS#1762] (r18551, r18549)
- Fix: Do not account for path reservation costs when entering a signal block via a 'block' signal. This way you will not get double penalties, both red signals and reservation costs, for the block signalled tracks [FS#2722] (r18535)
- Fix: [NewGRF] An industry NewGRF that defined a too small size for action0 prop 0A could cause a crash (r18527)
- Fix: Allegro does not like to work with extmidi, so warn the user about that [FS#3272] (r18520)
- Fix: When you pass a signal at danger, in a PBS controlled area, do not try to do the 'safe' thing and stop, but continue going; the user wanted the train to pass the signal at danger so (s)he has to suffer the consequences. Of course one can always stop the train manually [FS#2891] (r18515)
- Fix: No error message was created for the first fatal NewGRF error [FS#3368] (r18506)
- Fix: Improve airport movement on several airports [FS#3169] (r18505)
- Fix: Autoreplace and autorenew always reset their cargo sub type to 0. Now find a sub cargo type with the exact same name and use that, otherwise fallback to 0. So cargo sub types can be maintained via autoreplace *if* the new vehicle supports the same cargo sub type [FS#3159] (r18499)
- Fix: Cloning of vehicles could create vehicles with invalid cargo sub types for the build year of the vehicle. Fall back to another cargo sub type with the exact same name, otherwise fallback to cargo sub type 0 [FS#2616] (r18498)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Direction is accounted for long before motion counter is updated (r18479)
- Fix: Moving vehicles around/selling vehicle in the train depot could create states that are not allowed by the NewGRF attach callback [FS#3146] (r18472, r18470)
- Fix: Unselect an AI in the AI Settings window when it falls out of the range of active AIs [FS#3357] (r18436)
- Fix: Road vehicles would not pick an empty drive through stop. Now they will *if* the penalty for driving around is less than the occupancy penalty [FS#1944] (r18404)
- Fix: Long (articulated) road vehicles could block loading of others when the following road vehicle already got 'permission' to go to the next bay even when it could not reach it [FS#1495] (r18404)
- Fix: The tree 'which one to draw' hash was not anywhere near random and thus showed a very visible repeated pattern when only one tree type was used [FS#3343] (r18398)
- Fix: [NoAI] Make AIIndustryType::GetConstructionCost() return -1, if the industry is neither buildable nor prospectable (r18276)
- Fix: Use free type ascender/descender metrics to position font offset correctly (r18096)
- Fix: Make the 'pause' chat message when actually executing the pause command. This to prevent showing paused and especially unpaused to be shown when the state does not change. Output now mentions whether pause changes keep the game paused and what reasons for pausing there 'currently' are (r18052)
- Fix: [NoAI] Improve behaviour of (AIEngine|AIEventEnginePreview)::GetCargoType() and AIEngine::CanRefitCargo() wrt. articulated vehicles (r17898)
- Fix: [NewGRF] CB15 and CB36 (capacity) were not always called when they should [FS#3255] (r17897)
- Fix: Invalidate cache of vehicle vars 40-43 after testruns of certain commands, that change them temporarily (r17894)
- Fix: [OSX] The splash image was not displayed if the Quartz video driver was used (r17793)
- Fix: Do not let aircraft drive a while over the grass when landing at high altitude airports [FS#3259] (r17762
- Fix: Make the -c <config file> location relative to the current directory instead of the directory of the binary [FS#3247] (r17686)
- Fix: Some semaphore signals fell outside of the signal GUI. Now the signals are properly centred which should make that problem go away [FS#3242] (r17657)
- Fix: Some inconsistencies with the difficulty settings in the scenario editor. Also re-enable changing some difficulty settings (e.g. max loan) in the scenario editor [FS#3219] (r17644)
- Fix: Do not accept cargo produced in the same industry; generalise and improve the check used only for valuables (r17437)
- Fix: Pay only for cargo actually delivered, not for all cargo unloaded at station; can differ with 'stockpiling' industries (r17436)
- Fix: Improve movement of aircraft; do not make turns bigger than 45 degrees while in flight, do not move while turning on the ground (r17415, r17405)
- Fix: Crash in order GUI when changing some orders with both the mouse and keyboard at the exact same time [FS#2859] (r17384)
- Fix: Trains would not show smoke if the load/unload counter was not 0, though there does not seem to be a reason to check that variable anyhow anymore [FS#3162] (r17352)
- Fix: One was not offered to take over bankrupt companies anymore; caused by the introduction NoAI, although NewAI had the same problem too [FS#2769] (r17345)
- Fix: Minor improvements of the airport state machines (r17338, r17337, r17334)
- Fix: Road vehicles forgetting their servicing order when the path takes them away (in bird distance) from their destination first [FS#3057] (r17333)
- Fix: Mention of Ctrl modifier was missing from some tooltips [FS#3120] (r17300, r17297)
- Fix: Keep vehicle news and viewports following vehicles, when autoreplacing/renewing them [FS#3048] (r17147)
- Fix: Inconsistency between signs of stations and waypoints [FS#3081] (r17040)
- Fix: NewGRF stations would be triggering assertions for waypoints all over the place when using the more advanced station types [FS#2996] (r16909)
- Fix: Skipping a 'nearest depot order' because none could be found could cause multiple orders to get skipped [FS#2925] (r16457)
- Fix: Makedepend cannot handle the amount of files we have and it also miss some dependencies. So use our custom implementation of makedepend (r16307)
- Fix: Autopause and manual pausing conflict with each other, new game + pause on new game + autopause make the game not unpause on the first join [FS#2864] (r16242)
- Remove: [NoAI] AIVehicle::SkipToVehicleOrder as it was a duplicate of AIOrder.SkipToOrder (r18504)
- Remove: OPF for RVs and NTP for trains; both the oldest path finders (r18362)
- Remove: Support for gcc2. It has not been able to compile OpenTTD for months. All attempts to do another workaround failed (r16492)

- Fix: GCC 4.5 compiling (r18045)
- Fix: AIs failed to load their data from savegames by crashing them when they tried [FS#3290] (r18038)
- Fix: Screen jumped a bit for at least SDL and Allegro when right-click-dragging (r18030)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Improve parsing of RIFF data. Skip unknown chunks and check chunk sizes (r17999)
- Fix: When you start giving money (input window for amount), then get moved to spectators and you click 'Ok' a crash would occur (r17953)
- Fix: Use 24bpp BMP format instead of 32bpp for screenshots. Saves space and is supported by more image viewers (r17943)
- Fix: Close BMP file when making screenshot fails (r17941)
- Fix: Deadlock when trying to create screenshot with too long name (including path) (r17936)
- Fix: Crash when closing NewGRF parameter window with no NewGRF selected [FS#3291] (r17922)
- Fix: 32bpp BMP screenshots were in wrong colours on big endian machines and broken when screen width was not a multiple of 4 (r17910, r17909)
- Fix: Uninitialised values in some paths of loading TTO savegames [FS#3288] (r17908)
- Fix: Make the plane speed setting unchangeable in network games because it can be read by NewGRFs on game load and thus if it changes cause desyncs (r17902)
- Fix: [NewGRF] 'subtract-in' is also signed for production callback version 0 (r17857)
- Fix: [NewGRF] _date_fract runs from 0 to 73 since r2041. Variable 0x09 should not (r17824)
- Fix: Do not fail hard when no soundcard could be detected; just fall back on the null-driver [FS#3268] (r17788)
- Fix: CJK languages do not have spaces, so for adding newlines (multi line strings) we need to (properly) handle the case when there are no spaces instead of truncating the string [FS#3264] (r17772)
- Fix: Powernaut Helicopter got wrong 'load amount' (r17758)
- Fix: [NewGRF] 'last_value' and 'reseed' are shared between procedure and main chain, 'scope' and 'count' are not (r17672)
- Fix: Count only active clients (not those waiting for map download) when checking min_active_clients limit (r16506)


0.7.3 (2009-10-01)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: [NewGRF] Crash when trying to build an industry that has no industry layout defined [FS#3233] (r17638, r17633)

- Fix: [NewGRF] Memory leak when viewing the NewGRF settings of a server (r17563)
- Fix: [NewGRF] The NewGRF settings of (remote) network games did not get properly updated when the NewGRFs were rescanned causing reading of freed data [FS#2972] (r17562)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Close the 'Add NewGRF' window when you close the 'NewGRF Settings' window. The add window has a pointer to the settings which means that not deleting it would cause dereferencing an already freed pointer [FS#3206] (r17559)
- Fix: Vehicles waiting for their time table did not load anymore after their initial load was completed [FS#3201] (r17551)
- Fix: Aircraft were given an unfair advantage in station rating calculations (r17550)

- Change: Improve error output on missing or corrupt files (r17238)
- Change: [Unix] Only use colourised error output on interactive terminals (r17227)

- Change: [NoAI] When the API requests a string as parameter allow every squirrel type and convert to a string [FS#3101] (r17221)
- Change: Make strgen warn if the translation uses STRINGn or RAW_STRING instead of STRING (r17137, r17129)
- Change: [NoAI] Load the API before compiling an AI script so AIs can subclass API classes and use API constants as part of their own constants (r17043)
- Change: Add notion of Ctrl+Click in the tooltip for Loan borrow/repay buttons [FS#3066] (r16979)
- Change: [MSVC] Make all language files depend on english.txt (r16975)
- Change: There is no point in not randomising engine introduction-date before 1922. Instead disable the randomisation for the first two years after game-start, so you do not have to wait for the first engine (r16929)
- Fix: [Squirrel] In some cases the call stack would not be cleaned up properly during crash handling. Occasionally this causes asserts to be triggered or crashes [FS#3189] (r17515)
- Fix: When loading GRFConfigs from ini file, validate them wrt. duplicate GRF IDs [FS#3197] (r17510)
- Fix: When building a part fails during cloning, sell what was already cloned instead of leaving it 'for free'. Also make cloning multiheaded trains possible with with 'max - 1' vehicles existing [FS#3196] (r17509)
- Fix: [NoAI] The wrong value was restored to SetAllowDoCommand possible resulting in an AI that was not allowed to do any actions (r17500)
- Fix: Road vehicles could get lost when the preliminary destination (for the pathfinder heuristics) is unreachable [FS#3188] (r17491)
- Fix: When building roads is not allowed for town, then do not build the initial piece either [FS#3173] (r17444)
- Fix: Destruction of depots did not remove any vehicle lists related to the depot, causing windows pointing to deleted depots and (thus) crashes [FS#3180] (r17442)

- Fix: [NoAI] AIRail::RemoveRailTrack returned ERR_PRECONDITION_ERROR for road/rail-crossings (r17307)
- Fix: [NoAI] Reloading an AI started a new AI in the first available company slot causing other AIs to be started [FS#3153] (r17298)
- Fix: [NoAI] AITown::GetLastMonthTransported did not work as documented at all, make it return what AITown::GetLastMonthProduction did (r17293)

- Fix: Do not crash when the generate map does not contain a suitable location for a town [FS#2720] (r15689)
- Fix: Do not crash when someone substitutes the 'map generation' sprites with garbage [FS#2720] (r15685)
- Fix: Vehicle images would be determined during the process of moving the vehicle which means that only the (orientation) data for the vehicles in front of it is valid. Now the data for the vehicles behind the vehicle are valid too [FS#2546] (r15677)
- Fix: It was possible to remove rail tunnels/bridges and aqueducts build by rival companies [FS#2718] (r15667)
- Fix: Sorting of engines in the purchase list did not use the same numbers as the GUI showed, e.g. articulated parts were not taken into account when ordering by capacity [FS#2689] (r15666)
- Fix: Handling of aircraft crash counter did not take account of the reduced number of calls (from 6 down to 2) to the aircraft event handler, resulting in crashed aircraft taking three times longer than they should to clear. Compensate by increasing the counter by 3 on every call instead of 1 (r15665)
- Fix: Growing of vsize as (some) threads were not properly released (r15663)
- Fix: Do not mark a company as having ratings in a town when querying the cost of a command (r15662)

- Feature: Show required/already-delivered cargo needed for town-growth in town-view-window and only if it is really needed (r15559)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Support vehicle vars 0x47 and 0xF2 in purchase list (r15542)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Show the cargo subtype in the vehicle details window (r15480)
- Change: The background of the the waypoint sign is now in the company colour (r15593)
- Change: Allow the default debug level of 6 for a dedicated server to be overridden by -d (if used after -D) (r15543)
- Change: [NewGRF] To decide whether a vehicle is refittable do not test its current capacity for being zero, but always use the 'capacity property' (r15541)
- Fix: [Squirrel] Almost infinite loop in garbage collection (r15659)
- Fix: Undeterministic file sorting when the date is equal for all files [FS#2716] (r15657)
- Fix: Changing vehicle.dynamic_engines when there are already vehicles can cause crashes (r15656, r15586)
- Fix: Only ever call any vehicle callbacks after the whole articulated engine has been built (except 0x16) (r15654)
- Fix: C++'s new (this) is seldom a good idea as destructors of member variables are not run causing memory leaks [FS#2706] (r15652)
- Fix: [OSX] Hack around an OSX stupidity in < 10.4 w.r.t. signals by not having any signal handling support for OSX < 10.4 (r15648)
- Fix: Add an EngineOverrideManager to give the term 'compatible NewGRF' again some sense and to not crash because of trivial changes [FS#2612] (r15645)
- Fix: Closing a network connection twice in the case that sending packets starts failing while disconnecting [FS#2710] (r15644)
- Fix: Game crashes when network pools are empty, so always allocate at least one pool block [FS#2712] (r15641)
- Fix: Do not allow more than 64 road vehicles to reserve a slot at a single road stop. 255 + 1 gives trouble, but 64 is even more than the road stop would be able to handle within the slot timeout time [FS#2707] (r15635)
- Fix: Kicking/banning a client from the Client list window crashed the server [FS#2705] (r15628)
- Fix: UTF8 string handling could cause buffer overruns [FS#2698] (r15626)
- Fix: When trying to reserve a self-crossing path the failed reservation was sometimes not cleared completely [FS#2701] (r15619)
- Fix: Towns would only build houses where the grid would not be, even when they are not allowed to build roads and the user 'implements' another layout [FS#2661] (r15604)
- Fix: Crash when using an extraordinarily large sprite as cursor [FS#2696] (r15601)
- Fix: Crash when opening viewport while scrolling the map and the mouse 'lands' on the window decoration of the viewport [FS#2695] (r15598)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Refit-info in purchase list did only check the first articulated part (r15592)
- Fix: Change owner of waypoints and deleted stations when merging companies or when a company bankrupts (r15588)
- Fix: Last activity time not properly updated causing downloads to be aborted after a minute [FS#2684] (r15580)
- Fix: Force unload not working when trying to force unload at the station where you received the cargo [FS#2680] (r15574)
- Fix: Theoretical buffer overflow when a company with too long name funded a road reconstruction (r15572)
- Fix: When building signals by dragging from a pre/entry/combo block signal, the signal you started at became a normal block signal [FS#2674] (r15567)
- Fix: Dependency information was not requested after the content state was reset causing the dependencies not always being selected (and thus downloaded) automatically [FS#2675] (r15565)
- Fix: Crash when saving a preset with unknown NewGRFs [FS#2646] (r15561)
- Fix: The font width cache was not updated when changing fonts causing the font spacing to be off when changing fonts in-game (auto font detection) (r15557)
- Fix: -v null crashing in 2051 due to trying to show the high score of the spectator (r15554)
- Fix: [NoAI] Crash when setting a depot order to the southern part of a ship depot [FS#2656] (r15551)
- Fix: The keep_all_autosave setting was ignored for dedicated servers/spectators [FS#2651] (r15546)
- Fix: If a buoy was placed directly in front of a dock, that dock was seen as a buoy and thus skipped once within 3 tiles [FS#2653] (r15545)
- Fix: Extracting downloaded content did not work for Windows if one uses a non-ASCII path [FS#2650] (r15544)
- Fix: [NewGRF] When articulated parts have no available default cargo, use the cargo type of the first part for livery selection [FS#2617] (r15541)
- Fix: Testing of 'only_this' in CmdRefitRoadVeh() could be skipped by 'continue' (r15540)
- Fix: [NewGRF] If an aircraft cannot carry any available cargo, it should not be available either instead of falling back to passenger/mail. Just like the other vehicle types also do (r15539)
- Fix: Do not allow special sprite characters (e.g. the ship sprite) as characters in input like filenames or text that is sent over the network (r15537)
- Fix: The local command queue did not get properly cleaned when leaving a game meaning you could end up executing commands of the previous network game [FS#2644] (r15529)
- Fix: Do not try to find the AIs the server runs when joining a multiplayer server (r15525)
- Fix: Use distance to closest station tile as estimate for YAPF too (NPF already does so). This makes it behave 'better' with wide stations [FS#2631] (r15518)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Wagonoverrides and articulated engine parts use the colour scheme of the engine, but not its recolour callback, nor its 2CC flag. Same applies to roadvehicles [FS#2642] (r15517)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Livery overrides for articulated parts of roadvehicles were not applied (r15516)
- Fix: Make the join/spectate command require to be connected to a network game; in SP it could lead to crashes (r15514)
- Fix: Generating a map with the original map generator with freeform edges on resulted in a crash [FS#2641] (r15511)
- Fix: Pre-0.5 OpenTTD stored new_nonstop and full_load_any in a different way, savegame conversion was not working for them (r15500)
- Fix: Crash when opening the game options when the currently loaded base graphics pack has less than 2 valid graphics files. For example when someone replaces all his/her original base graphics with custom work (but keeps the name) or renames the dos ones to windows or vice versa [FS#2630] (r15476)


0.7.0-beta1 (2009-02-16)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Feature: Make it possible to have multiple windows with edit box open simultaneously (r15424)
- Feature: Add ability to select which base graphics set is used from the Game Options window. The change takes effect when the window is closed. This option can only be used from the intro menu, as reloading graphics during a game may cause issues (r15389)
- Feature: Do not draw superfluous catenary wires [FS#1761] (r15347)
- Feature: Add option to group and subtotal expenses list in the company finance window (r15301)
- Feature: Allow moving clients between companies/spectators by the server and the clients themselves (r15242)
- Feature: Native support for Transport Tycoon (Original) savegames (r15216)
- Feature: Allow terraforming of the tiles at the edges of the map (r15190)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Allow a grf to customise house name via callback 0x14D, during Tile Inquiry process (r15172)
- Feature: Downloading content from a central server (content.openttd.org) where authors can upload their NewGRFS/AI etc. This should make joining servers that use only NewGRFs that are distributed via this system easier as the players can download the NewGRFs from within the game. It should also make it easier to see whether there are updates for NewGRFs and make the necessary updates (r15126)
- Feature: Add support for IP range bans using CIDR notation (r15094)
- Feature: An AI framework so people can write their own AIs. This also removes the old cheating and heavily broken AI (r15027)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Support var 0x45 (curvature info) also for road vehicles (r14945)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Automatically set last engine ageing year to the last 'introduction year plus half model life', to allow engines later than 2050 to appear (r14926)
- Feature: Distant joining of stations (r14919)
- Feature: Advanced setting to keep various building tools active, which are usually closed after placing an object (r14902)
- Feature: Remove the window limit, but leave a configurable limit on the number of non-sticky non-vital windows (r14899)
- Feature: Allow road vehicles to move multiple steps in a tick (code based on train movement code) and add support for RV prop 15. This gives RVs a maximum speed of 318mph instead 79mph. This only implements higher speeds, not 'realistic acceleration' (r14869)
- Feature: Automatic reversing in front of block signals can now be disabled by setting pf.wait_oneway_signal respectively pf.wait_twoway_signal to 255 (r14852)
- Feature: Few (optional) optimisations to making (initial) orders; like keeping goto selected [FS#1984] (r14827)
- Feature: Make the road grids of town match, when all are using the same road layout of course [FS#2390] (r14821)
- Feature: Pressing CTRL while dragging to build a bridge builds the last built bridge type if possible [FS#2238] (r14805)
- Feature: Make the date format for default savegame/screenshot names configurable (r14792)
- Feature: Allow scrolling with the left mouse button pressed (if enabled). Primarily useful for systems with touch screen (r14789)
- Feature: Allow up to 15 companies (r14735)
- Feature: Allow up to 255 clients in multiplayer games (r14730)
- Feature: When the chosen language is not supported by the current font, try to find a font that does and use that instead (r14618)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Action0Industries property 24 (industry supplies default name for nearby station) (r14598)
- Feature: Non-destructive autofill with option to keep waiting times [FS#1124] (r14592)
- Feature: Stop-in-depot order; after this order you have to manually start the vehicle again (or sell it) (r14524)
- Feature: Arrow key scrolling in the server list (r14517)
- Feature: Initial support for handling bidirectional scripts and connecting Arabic characters (r14479)
- Feature: Allow sorting vehicles by remaining life time (r14352)
- Feature: Ability to reset name to default/automatic value (for vehicles, engines, towns, groups, stations, waypoints, managers and companies) (r14334)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Add Variational Action 2 Variable 0x47 for houses, Coordinates of the house tile (r14294)
- Feature: Allow overriding the palette of the base GRFs. This way you can play with NewGRFs made for the Windows palette with the DOS palettes base GRFs (and vice versa). Note that for this to work correctly ALL NewGRFs must use the same palette; mix and match is not yet supported (r14229)
- Feature: Double click to join selected server/company (r14209)
- Feature: Allow both the German as well as non-German toyland graphics as 'correct' and official graphics (r14197)
- Feature: Allow people to create their own base graphics easily and without requiring code changes (r14197)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Add support for property 0x13 for Bridges. In other words, one can now specifies a 16 bits cost multiplier (r14172)
- Feature: Make it possible to choose between the DOS and Windows graphics packs while retaining the possibility to override the palette (r14151)
- Feature: Increase the size of the console backlog. Now it'll only remove backlog items when there are more than a threshold and when they are there longer than (another) threshold (r14056)
- Feature: Make it possible to filter list_patches output like it is done for other list_* console commands (r14041)
- Feature: Path based signalling (r13926-13967)
- Feature: Show [total-]cargo info in depot when [ctrl-]right-clicking on vehicle (r13923)
- Feature: NewGRF presets, selected by a drop down list in the NewGRF window. Presets are saved in the config file (r13781)
- Feature: Add a few extra columns with information to the server list (r13732)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Add var 65 in Variational Action 2 Variables for Houses (r13603)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Implement var 63, variational action2 variable for Houses. Or, in more simple terms, the check for the animation frame of nearby house (r13519)
- Feature: Aqueducts (r13464)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Add var 0x69 for industries, long format construction date (r13443)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Add long format introduction and maximum construction year for house (r13437)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Add access to current long year and date from Action 7/9/D and VarAction2 (23/24 or A3/A4), and add access to (long format) building year, in Variational Action2 Variable 49 for Vehicles (r13376)
- Feature: Splitting of the main toolbar when the resolution becomes very low so the buttons are still visible and usable (r13339)
- Feature: Make news messages use a linked list instead of a moving circular buffer. This makes it possible to store more news messages in the history (r13317)
- Feature: The number of news messages is reduced by removing every news message that is a configurable amount older than when it would not be shown in the newspaper popup/ticker, which is e.g. a month for industry production changes and half a year for subsidy offers. As a result the more important messages will stay longer in the message history (if longer than 30 messages) (r13317)
- Feature: Allow to have more than only two airports per town. The number of airports is now controlled by the noise each of them generates, the distance from town's centre and how tolerant the town is (13226)
- Feature: Introducing the so called 'engine pool' which primarily removes the fixed engine type limits and also happens to allow (with the patch option 'dynamic_engines') multiple NewGRF vehicle sets to coexist (r12924)
- Feature: [NewGRF] The ability to play NewGRF sounds for industries and stations (r12817)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Add some support for NewGRF station animation (r12798)
- Feature: Sorting vehicle lists by road vehicle/train length (r12766)
- Feature: Conditional 'skip/jump' orders (r12667)
- Feature: Ability to send a vehicle (using default orders) to the nearest depot (r12661)
- Feature: Ability to force a vehicle to not load or to not unload at a station (r12650)
- Feature: Four different non-stop types, individually selectable per order. Replaces 'TTDP compatible order' setting (r12648)
- Feature: Three different load type in a single game instead of two. One can choose full load all and full load any instead of full load being governed by the 'full load any' patch setting (r12648)
- Feature: Financial and Player Selection Face windows are now remembering their position when toggling sizes (r12634)
- Feature: Show what cargoes a station could be supplied with (r12596)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Add random action 2 type 84. For vehicles only (r12452)
- Feature: [NewGRF] Add support for var A2/22 for action 7/9/D: Difficulty level (r12449)
- Feature: Add +/- toggle buttons to station cargo waiting list to show/hide the detailed transferred cargo information (r12446)
- Feature: Open the time table when pressing the order button while pressing the CTRL key (r12441)
- Feature: On Screen Keyboard for input fields so someone without a keyboard can enter text too [FS#1846] (r12425)
- Change: When checking for unique names, compare only with manually set names [FS#1923] (r14958)
- Change: Apply the 'warn if train's income is negative' setting to other vehicle types, too (r14835)
- Change: When loading games in 'network' mode use the start date of the save game for the server and all clients when loading the NewGRFs instead of the current date. Prevents desyncs caused by action 7/9s skipping parts of the GRF based on the date or some other variables that can differ at NewGRF load time (r14769)
- Change: Only say a engine/vehicle is refittable when it can be refitted to at least two cargo type or when it has subcargoes (r14683)
- Change: [NewGRF] Since our NewGRF handling is better than it used to be, disable a NewGRF if unexpected sprites are reached (r14184)
- Fix: A town could build a statue under a bridge [FS#2618] (r15397)
- Fix: Multiple vehicles could be filling the timetable and only the data from one vehicle would be taken. Now only allow one to be filling at a time [FS#2466] (r15382)
- Fix: When testing for parallel road two tiles away, do not move more than one tile along the road (r15381)
- Fix: [NewGRF] The subcargo returned by vehicle variable 0x42 should be the most-common-subcargo of the most-common-cargo. If nothing is transported 0x..FFFF00 should be returned (r15378)
- Fix: A tram circling around in a depot did never actually 'enter' the depot [FS#2605] (r15375)
- Fix: Changing town road layout in-game caused ugly road networks [FS#2121] (r15340)
- Fix: Company could never have auto-assigned colour 0 (dark blue) (r15281)
- Fix: Deadlock (with wide fonts) or desync when generating manager name (r15279)
- Fix: Close all windows *before* starting a new game/loading a game instead of doing that as one of the latest steps of loading the game. This caused, in some cases, the NewGRF settings to be reset when the game was already loaded resulting in instant desyncs when joining a network game [FS#2577] (r15256)
- Fix: Aircraft could be 'loading in the air' or have zero speed while in air after converting old savegames [FS#2571] (r15230, r15227)
- Fix: Tile error location not reset when levelling land causing a tile to be highlighted when there was nothing to flatten [FS#2542] (r15138)
- Fix: Signs with sign 'Sign' were lost when converting from TTD savegames (r15137)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Add support for 8 byte action7/9 data, used as a mask for GRFID checks (r15114)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Keep industry variables 8E and 8F in sync with 93, when changing production using results 0D, 0E or 0F of callback 29 or 35 (r15103)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Disable a NewGRF from loading if it contains multiple Action 8s (r14979)
- Fix: Wrong defaults for service interval when switching between service interval in days and service interval in percentages [FS#2508] (r14959)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Building new station parts did not allocate a new station spec effectively breaking variable 41. This was due to the limited number of station specs that we can have per station. This fix makes newly build station parts create a new spec until one cannot allocate new station specs anymore and it'll revert to the old behaviour (sharing station specs) [FS#1832] (r14956)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Station specs did not get deallocated when building a new station part over them (r14955)
- Fix: Sharing/cloning/inserting of orders that the/a vehicle (in the shared list) cannot go to (wrong station type etc) [FS#1890] (r14954)
- Fix: The 'animation state' of the bubbles was stored in a variable that was not stored in the savegame. Using a variable that gets saved in the savegame solves the desync and makes it a bit clearer [FS#2512] (r14931)
- Fix: Abort dragging of vehicles in the group window when they are deleted [FS#2500] (r14925)
- Fix: Do not unnecessarily reset the cursor, when a different vehicle is dragged (r14924)
- Fix: [NewGRF] First create all articulated parts of roadvehicles, then call callback 36 capacity, also call it for all articulated parts (r14903)
- Fix: Overflow of number of orders per vehicle [FS#2495] (r14830)
- Fix: Off-by-one causing possible out-of-bounds reads (r14811)
- Fix: In an MP game in SP mode no company would go bankrupt. Furthermore companies that passed the 'bankrupt' period (4 quarters) would not go bankrupt when loading the game back in MP. Now any company that is in MP or not 'currently controlled by the player' in SP will bankrupt [FS#1993] (r14750)
- Fix: Do not let any disaster vehicle (Helicopter or Airplane) target invalid industry (r14746)
- Fix: Memory leak in Action 0x0F (new town names) (r14737)
- Fix: Writing a single char to the config file caused reading outside a buffer (r14729)
- Fix: First transfer the whole load of a vehicle chain to industries before triggering any processing. This reduces callback usage and resolves critical rounding errors when using input-cargo-multipliers instead of production callbacks [FS#2460] (r14705)
- Fix: Zeppeliner (disaster) should target st->airport_tile, not st->xy (r14694)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Gradual filling graphics were not chosen according to the NewGRF spec [FS#2435] (r14678)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Check sprite size when executing action 6 (r14674)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Property 7 and callback 12 were broken for aircraft. Now callback 12 is properly called also for 'mail'. If the callback is not used, 'mail' uses 1/4 of property 7 (rounded up) [FS#2444] (r14672)
- Fix: Possible stack corruption when reading corrupted sprites [FS#2415] (r14610)
- Fix: [NewGRF] Return the current year as construction year for unfinished houses (r14608)
- Fix: [NewGRF] When callback 1E fails, use the standard random colour (r14605)
- Fix: The company ID is off-by-one with respect to the rest of the GUI in the cheat window [FS#2422] (r14603)
- Fix: The range for kicking/banning clients is based on the maximum number of clients, not the maximum number of companies [FS#2414] (r14588)
- Fix: Allow capacity callbacks (15, 36) to return zero capacity (r14578)
- Fix: Crashes when a NewGRF sends an invalid string [FS#2395] (r14563)
- Fix: Order pool seemed to look full when it was not as it only checked whether it was possible to allocate a new block of pool items instead of checking for free pool items (r14547)
- Fix: Do not deliver cargo to industries not inside station catchment area [FS#2138] (r14530)
- Fix: Allocate stub (empty) sound entries when loading an empty/corrupt/incorrectly sized sample.cat instead of making valid NewGRFs fail to load (r14527)
- Fix: Make sure trains stop at the end of a station; a 3/8th length train did stop 2/8th of its length too early causing a 63/8th long train not to fit in a 4 tile station [FS#2379] (r14526)
- Fix: Small possible chance of desync due to sorting on pointer instead of by (station) index [FS#2348] (r14463)
- Fix: When a road stop gets moved make sure to update the destination of RVs going to that road stop [FS#2330] (r14446)
- Fix: Support for spaces in directories passed to ./configure [FS#1802] (r14440)
- Fix: Trains would sometimes move one time too often/little when moving from diagonal<->non-diagonal tracks [FS#1793] (r14436)
- Fix: Balance the monthly random industry changes, by introducing a daily random industry change [FS#1885] (r14332)
- Fix: Save the palette of the loaded NewGRFs in the savegame, so joining with a server using Windows palette will make a client with the DOS palette do palette conversion and (thus) not cause a desync (r14233)
- Fix: Glitches (alignment issues/inconsistent vehicle graphics) in original graphics (r14214, r14211)
- Fix: One could not get a list of vehicles sharing an order when the number of orders was 0; you could see that the vehicles had a shared order though [FS#2085] (r14097)
- Fix: Various assorted autoreplace issues/misbehaviours [FS#1264, FS#2037, FS#2038, FS#2110] (r14083)
- Fix: The autoreplace gui showed vehicle types for replacement which CmdSetAutoReplace() did not accept (r14037)
- Fix: Automatically recalculate inflation if NewGRFs are changed and cargo types are added, so that cargo payment rates are correct [FS#2074] (r13836)


0.6.3 (2008-10-01)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: NewGRF VarAction 2 variable 43 for industries saw MP_VOID tiles as land tiles and was inefficient (r14417, r14416, r14415)
- Fix: Possible buffer overrun/wrong parameter type passed to printf (r14414, r14397)
- Fix: Generation seed set using -G was always overwritten by -g (r14408)

0.6.3-RC1 (2008-09-22)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: Invalid v->u.air.targetairport could cause crashes at several places [FS#2300] (r14383, r14344, r14343)
- Fix: Moving the first vehicle of a train elsewhere might require a new unitnumber for the remaining chain which might not be available (r14384)
- Fix: Trams jumping when reversing on a single trambit (like caused during road construction reworks) or when (manually) reversing in a corner [FS#1852] (r14371)
- Fix: Multiheaded parts in free wagon chains were not connected (could cause desyncs) (r14366, r14362)

- Fix: NewGRF rail continuation would always mark a tunnel on the same axis as connected, even when the tunnel faces the wrong direction (r13734)
- Fix: Assumption that non-north tiles of a house do not have the 1x1 building bit set was flawed with some NewGRFs. This caused the amount of houses to differ, which causes the town radii to differ, which causes desyncs when towns are expanded (r13729)
- Fix: Possible desync on the autorenew settings 20+ game years (i.e. 4.5+ hours) after a company was started (r13718)

Effectively meaning that if someone replaces the first bridge with a bridge that can be only 3 tiles longs then only other bridges that can be 3 tiles long will be buildable, but only if they are 3 tiles long [FS#2100] (r13611)
- Fix: Signal states could be propagated through waypoints built in orthogonal axis (r13589)
- Fix: [OSX] 10.5 failed to switch to fullscreen (r13584)
- Fix: RVs continuing onto next DT station when they are build adjacent to them [FS#2040] (r13581)
- Fix: Disable static NewGRFs when non-static NewGRFs query them in the context of network games. This makes it impossible for static NewGRFs to disable non-static NewGRFs and 'bad' things happening because the non-static NewGRF does not know about the static NewGRF (r13576)

- Fix: Incorrect usage of strtoul (r13508)

- Fix: Possible out of bounds array access (r12809)
- Fix: Enforce autorenew values range in command (r12808)

- Feature: [NewGRF] Add support for Action 13, which allows you to translate GRF-specific texts. The translations will only be shown if you are using a language with a GRF language id and if a string has not already been set specifically for the language you are using (r9037)
- Feature: Translation dependent formatting of dates (r8906)
- Feature: If an action 7/9 leads to skipping the rest of the file, disable the NewGRF if an action 8 has not been encountered yet (r8831)

- Feature: Increase sprite limit from 16384 sprites to 16777216 sprites (r8128, r8129)
- Feature: Add the ability to load savegames when you do not have the exact GRF files in your list. GRF files that are found based on GRF ID (but not on matching md5sum) are used instead of disabling them. This does not affect MP games, there you still need an exact match (r8106)

- Feature: Allow to build bridges of arbitrary rail/road combinations (including signals) (r7573)
- Codechange: Do not allow configuration changes, that NewGRFs can directly use to change their behaviour, during network games as this can cause desyncs (r11452)
- Codechange: Make opening a new toolbar not overlapping its parent one, by locating it under the parent, and aligned with the left side of it [FS#1310] (r11256)
- Codechange: Do not brute force determine the first vehicle in the chain or previous vehicle, but do it by properly accounting the previous and first pointers when updating the next pointer. This gives a performance increase of about 15% when there are a lot of vehicles in the game (r11011)
- Codechange: Cache expensive NewGRF station variables during sprite lookups/callbacks (r10509)
- Codechange: Keep track of the origin, time of travel and accumulated feeder share (transfers) of individual pieces of cargo. This means that cargo is not thrown on a big pile when it is put in a station or unloaded at a station, however the GUI does not reflect these changes yet so you will not actually see it (r10266)
- Codechange: Do not limit the cost of tunnels (r10248)
- Codechange: Add new vehicle hash table for collision detection and finding vehicles on a tile. The hash area scanned is far smaller than the old hash table, which is now used for viewport updates only. This should give a significant performance improvement for games with many vehicles (r10111)
- Codechange: Do not redraw all station tiles when cargo is added or removed if the station has no custom graphics (r10062)

- Codechange: Remove the landscaping button from the build toolbars (r8143)
- Codechange: [NewGRF] Do not mark as unsafe those NewGRFs that set their own parameters (via action D) and/or change only bridge sprite table layouts (action 0, property D) (r7831)
- Fix: The CHANCE16 functions were biased; a 32768 in 65536 chance was really a 32769 in 65536 chance (r11454)
- Fix: Do not create shores in canyons (r11438)
- Fix: Starting OpenTTD with DOS files made it look weird out of the box (r11433)

- Fix: Loading too many GRFs was not handled gracefully causing crashes and such [FS#1377] (r11355)
- Fix: Add missing elrail sprites for some rail build buttons/cursors (r11350)
- Fix: Trees can now be planted on bare land without making it grassy, planting tree in desert does not make it grassy for the first tile-cycle and when a tree dies in desert, it no longer becomes a snowy tile for the first tile-cycle (r11244)
- Fix: The explosion vehicles were placed too far to the south [FS#1312] (r11234)
- Fix: One could sell vehicles that were crashed in a depot, which would still yield money/one could construct trains of crashed vehicles [FS#1307, FS#1228] (r11229, r11230)
- Fix: Electric trains were not shown as stopped in depots when converting it from elrail -> normal rail [FS#1260] (r11167)
- Fix: A lot of graphical glitches by changing some bounding boxes. It is not perfect yet, but a *very* good step into the right direction (r11128)
- Fix: When autorenew is enabled and it cannot renew the vehicle anymore (because the player cannot build the engine), the ageing warnings as if autorenew is not enabled are shown [FS#553] (r11064)
- Fix: Inconsistency between rail<->elrail conversions of different kinds of rail containing tiles (normal rail, stations, depots, etc) [FS#1182] (r11059)
- Fix: Crash when having the Finance window opened of the player you are cheating to [FS#1177] (r11028)
- Fix: Switching players (using the cheat) crashed on Big Endian machines [FS#1150] (r11023)
- Fix: The canal border determination did not take oil rigs into consideration (r11022)

- Fix: One could not give money when (s)he had too much money or rather: when casting the amount of money to an int32 becomes negative [FS#1174] (r11020)
- Fix: When determining the gender of a string, do not assume that the gender is in the front of the string when there can be case switching code at that location [FS#1104] (r10792)
- Fix: Determining whether there is a tunnel going under the lowered area is only needed in two directions instead of all four, so take the directions (one for each axis) to the nearest border (along the given axis) [FS#1058] (r10686)
- Fix: Graphical glitches when the 'link landscape toolbar' patch is turned on when opening one of the construction toolbars [FS#1076] (r10685)
- Fix: Trolly AI did not know about steep slopes, and used wrong tileh in some cases [FS#1070] (r10655)
- Fix: Be consistent with the space between the company name and the player number, i.e. always put a space between them [FS#1052] (r10627)

- Fix: When Cheat-Window is open and a new month happens, the window was not redrawn instantly (r10547)
- Fix: You can now have both Available Train as Available Ship window open [FS#1026] (r10546)
- Fix: Cargo payment rates overflow and cargo payment rates diverge from cost rates making it impossible to make any profit after a certain number of years. Both are solved by stopping the inflation after 170 years; there is absolutely no point in continuing the inflation after that as it only makes the game have overflows at some point that cannot be solved; using larger variables only delays the inevitable [FS#1028] (r10541)
- Fix: Error dialogue was sometimes shown on all clients when a command failed instead of only the client that actually did the command [FS#1015] (r10501)
- Fix: The network protocol check for required NewGRFs sent static NewGRFs too (r10414)
- Fix: When landscape generating, allow for 200ms between screen updates instead of updating every 200ms. Previously slow screen updates would result in very slow map generation (r10396)
- Fix: One could only build a limited number of stations before one had to rename them [FS#278] (r10320)
- Fix: Acceleration not calculated properly when a train goes up a hill between tunnels [FS#786] (r10317)
- Fix: [YAPF] Now it is no longer needed to invalidate the YAPF segment cache every tick in MP (read performance increase). Segment cost now does not contain the curves between segments. As a result the cache should be now accurate (r10302)
- Fix: [YAPF] Assertion triggered in some special cases [FS#901] (r10301)
- Fix: Flush stdout on dedicated server output to ensure an update of stdout [FS#775] (r10295)
- Fix: With smooth_economy, when industry production hit 32, it stayed there for ever. Give it some chance to get out of that uber-lowness (although it is a very slim chance, at least it has one) (r10290)
- Fix: Also age engines that are not front-engines [FS#202] (r10288)
- Fix: Money overflow bugs in many locations [FS#723] (r10212)

- Fix: Do not assume that trains running on monorail/maglev cannot smoke/spark (r9801)
- Fix: Play sound effects based on the engine class, not the rail type (r9800)
- Fix: Separate engine class and engine running cost class (r9799)
- Fix: Clone vehicles will no longer refit for free (r9689)
- Fix: Improved loading does not use a huge amount of processing power anymore when having a lot of trains [FS#423] (r9683)
- Fix: Truncate the NewGRF information text in the NewGRF GUI if it is too long (r9449)
- Fix: Cancel in password queries reduces amount of players in the network game when they have not joined the game yet [FS#688] (r9378)
- Fix: If all news-setting buttons show 'full', make the ALL-button show 'full' too (r9137)
- Fix: Open and close messages now have their own setting, so you can hide economy changes, but do show open/close of industries [FS#525] (r9097)
- Fix: Do not make owner signs transparent, as then you loose the information who it owns [FS#637] (r9067)
- Fix: Store the owner of a statue, so when it gets removed, the town is notified of it [FS#638] (r9066)
- Fix: Inactive connections are not automatically kicked, i.e. people who only open a telnet (or similar) connection to a server [FS#115] (r9038)
- Fix: Do not select a disabled platform length/number of track count when going out of drag-drop mode [FS#450] (r8999)
- Fix: Make an aircraft at 400 km/h go as fast as a train at 400 km/h (r8973)
- Fix: You were unable to build roads in the scenario editor when there is no town 0, even though there are other towns (r8608)
- Fix: Road Vehicles now can obtain a slot even if the station is very spread out [FS#577] (r8536)
- Fix: Allow lumber mill to cut trees only when they are full grown (r8535)
- Fix: Segmentation fault when the toolbar gets removed and you have selected one of the items in a sub menu of the toolbar (r8533)
- Fix: Remove phantom oil rigs sometimes present in old savegames (r8485)
- Fix: When a station is removed, vehicles do not get excessive payment any longer, as the origin TILE is now stored as long as the origin STATION for the transported cargos (r8144)
- Fix: The game could crash when the chat key (<ENTER>) is pressed too vehemently during the join of the game. Your client's id does not exist in the clients list yet, and returns NULL (r8132)
- Fix: Rail vehicles can no longer enter tunnels or bridgeheads with wrong railtype (r7976)
- Fix: When path finding onto a bridge or tunnel end from previous tile (but not warping from the opposite end) check the enter direction. This fixes signal setting if a rail ends on the top of a tunnel end (r7718)
- Fix: When following path for signals, do not skip back to the previous tile, as for tunnels and bridge ends the entering direction is wrong (r7717)
- Fix: [YAPF] Suppress 'Train is lost' message if path finding ended on the first two-way red signal due to YAPF.rail_firstred_twoway_eol option (r7628)
- Fix: [OPF] Signal update was incorrectly propagated (r7620)

- Fix: Make the AI not crash when it has ships as the AI does not support them [FS#1133] (r10942)
- Fix: Trains would not get flooded when they are at the lower part of a tile that would become a coast tile after flooding [FS#1127] (r10892)
- Fix: Removing road with the road removal tool would also work with a negative bank account, making the bank account even more negative than it was [FS#1125] (r10890)
- Fix: Some isocodes were wrong, resulting in some NewGRF not working properly for the affected languages (r10877)
- Fix: [Windows] Do not try to minimise or restore the window when closing OpenTTD [FS#998] (r10835)
- Fix: Trains going over bridges would get the 'going down hill' accelerate bonus, which causes trains to go faster on bridges than they would be going on level land [FS#1096] (r10739)
- Fix: Trains being split into two pieces when loading an old savegame [FS#1062] (r10735)
- Fix: [OS/2] Fix chdir problem with open/save dialogue (r10650)

- Fix: Ship's maximum speed wrongly shown [FS#1013] (r10497)
- Fix: [OSX] Of the resolution is changed to something that is too high for the monitor, then it is reduced to fit the monitor size, solving several crashes and graphical glitches [FS#458] (r10410)
- Fix: NPF was leaking memory each time it got initialised, except for the first time (r10357)
- Fix: [YAPF] 'target_seen' flag that is set prematurely in some cases (1 tile long cached segment followed by target station) which caused asserts to trigger [FS#884] (r10199)

- Feature: Console command to get the current game date (r10137)
- Fix: Waypoints could be renamed when you are not the owner (r10368)
- Fix: Smooth economy did not close primary industries and it allowed increasing of production of industries that should not have rising productions (r10348, r10347, r10290)
- Fix: Acceleration for trains on slopes is not calculated properly [FS#786] (r10344, r10317)
- Fix: The 'old' pathfinders (OPF and NPF) for road vehicles could not find a path when in a tunnel [FS#290] (r10345)
- Fix: Only add the autoreplace menu when autoreplace actually knows about the group [FS#880] (r10337)
- Fix: Signal state sometimes not properly set when the signal 'pathfinder' reached the end of a line [FS#910] (r10336)
- Fix: News messages were shown over the endgame/highscore windows [FS#943] (r10333)
- Fix: Rail could be destroyed when building tunnels (r10306)
- Fix: Flush the output of the dedicated server console (r10295)
- Fix: The 'pause' key did not work in the scenario editor (r10294)

- Fix: Do not look in every direction for tunnels when building one, one direction is enough (r10258)
- Fix: [Windows] Do not mess desktop when using ALT-TAB [FS#876] (r10251, r10186)
- Fix: Take the age of the front vehicle for station rating (r10246)
- Fix: Terraforming wipes out canals. Now you always have to remove the canal before terraforming, instead of 'just' removing the canal [FS#594] (r10240)
- Fix: Only 2 trains could crash at one time as collision checking stopped on the first hit. This could technically cause desyncs in network games as the collision hash order is not guaranteed [FS#892] (r10222)
- Fix: Land under foundations was terraform when it should not be terraformed [FS#882, FS#890] (r10219)
- Fix: Do not make a 270 degree turn on the international airport when a 90 degree turn is enough (r10187)

- Fix: When you got a sufficiently small resolution, there is a possibility for a division by zero when a sound is played (r10138)
- Fix: When removing a dock, a ship will always try to reach the old location of the dock even when it cannot anymore because it the old location of the dock is now land instead of water [FS#810] (r10131)
- Fix: SetCurrentGrfLangID returned the wrong language ids for most languages (r10130)
- Fix: Some NewGRFs use the same (unused in the 'current' climate) sprite IDs. Normally this gives some artifacts, but when one NewGRF expects it to be a sprite and another NewGRF overwrites it with a non-sprite nasty things happen (drawing a non-sprite crashes OpenTTD) [FS#838] (r10109)
- Fix: Multiple subsequent 'give money' actions could result in duplicate messages that money has been transferred when it only happened once, or tell you paid money when you did not [FS#834, FS#839] (r10087, r10085)

- Fix: Do not use override engine type for articulated wagon parts (r10048)
- Fix: Sprite resulting from '?' substitution was reloaded into the cache entry for SPR_IMG_QUERY instead of the original sprite cache entry. This resulted in unaccounted missing sprite cache memory, and was exacerbated because the original missing sprite was not cached, so it did it again and again and again. Slowdowns and boom (r10038)
- Fix: One could build on (some) slopes when building on slopes was disabled [FS#823] (r10030)
- Fix: When deleting the first engine of a train with multiple engines, only reopen the train window if the player had the original train window open. This fixes 'random' windows opening for multiple players of the same company (r10028)
- Fix: When selling trains, if there were no wagons between multiheaded engines the rear part could be checked despite having already been deleted (10023)


0.5.2 (2007-05-29)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Feature: Add threading support for MorphOS (r9759)
- Fix: Bridges and tunnels were not always removed on bankruptcy, thus leaving tunnels/bridges with an invalid owner that would crash the game when clicking with the query tool on them (r9966)
- Fix: Null pointer dereference under MorphOS and AmigaOS (r9861)


0.5.2-RC1 (2007-05-16)
