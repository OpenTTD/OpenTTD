 verbatim, but changing it is not allowed.

 Source code copyright DJ Delorie is distributed under the terms of the
 GNU General Public Licence, with the following exceptions:
 .
 * Sources used to build crt0.o, gcrt0.o, libc.a, libdbg.a, and
   libemu.a are distributed under the terms of the GNU Library General
   Public License, rather than the GNU GPL.
 .
 * Any existing copyright or authorship information in any given source
   file must remain intact.  If you modify a source file, a notice to that
   effect must be added to the authorship information in the source file.
 .
 * Runtime binaries, as provided by DJ in DJGPP, may be distributed
   without sources ONLY if the recipient is given sufficient information
   to obtain a copy of djgpp themselves.  This primarily applies to
   go32-v2.exe, emu387.dxe, and stubedit.exe.
 .
 * Runtime objects and libraries, as provided by DJ in DJGPP, when
   linked into an application, may be distributed without sources ONLY
   if the recipient is given sufficient information to obtain a copy of

Comment:
 Given only the exe2coff.c file is distributed in the source distribution (and
 nothing in Debian binary distribution), it seems only the 2nd condition
 applies.

License: Custom binary-only license
 This is release 5.  The files in this binary distribution may be redistributed
 under the GPL (with source) or without the source code provided:
 .
 * CWSDPMI.EXE or CWSDPR0.EXE are not modified in any way except via CWSPARAM.
 .
 * CWSDSTUB.EXE internal contents are not modified in any way except via
   CWSPARAM or STUBEDIT.  It may have a COFF image plus data appended to it.
 .
 * Notice to users that they have the right to receive the source code and/or
   binary updates for CWSDPMI.  Distributors should indicate a site for the
   source in their documentation.
Comment:
 Files are distributed as binary only, so the second option in the license
 ("without source code provided: ...") is applicable.
